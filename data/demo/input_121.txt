BACKGROUND: Manual curation of biological databases, an expensive and 
labor-intensive process, is essential for high quality integrated data. In this 
paper we report the implementation of a state-of-the-art Natural Language 
Processing system that creates computer-readable networks of regulatory 
interactions directly from different collections of abstracts and full-text 
papers. Our major aim is to understand how automatic annotation using 
Text-Mining techniques can complement manual curation of biological databases. 
We implemented a rule-based system to generate networks from different sets of 
documents dealing with regulation in Escherichia coli K-12.
RESULTS: Performance evaluation is based on the most comprehensive 
transcriptional regulation database for any organism, the manually-curated 
RegulonDB, 45% of which we were able to recreate automatically. From our 
automated analysis we were also able to find some new interactions from papers 
not already curated, or that were missed in the manual filtering and review of 
the literature. We also put forward a novel Regulatory Interaction Markup 
Language better suited than SBML for simultaneously representing data of 
interest for biologists and text miners.
CONCLUSION: Manual curation of the output of automatic processing of text is a 
good way to complement a more detailed review of the literature, either for 
validating the results of what has been already annotated, or for discovering 
facts and information that might have been overlooked at the triage or curation 
stages.
