Standardized documentation workflow within an electronic health record to track 
pharmacists' interventions in pediatric ambulatory care clinics.

McNicol M, Kuhn C, Sebastian S.

OBJECTIVES: To describe the implementation of a standardized documentation 
workflow within an electronic health record (EHR) and to track pharmacists' 
interventions in pediatric ambulatory care clinics.
SETTING: Ambulatory care clinics and a transitions-of-care (TOC) service within 
a pediatric health care system in central Ohio.
PRACTICE DESCRIPTION: Ambulatory clinical pharmacists work as integrated members 
of the health care team in 7 pediatric ambulatory care clinics and a TOC service 
to achieve the best medication-related outcomes for patients.
PRACTICE INNOVATION: A standardized documentation workflow was established among 
ambulatory clinical pharmacists to document the interventions made in their 
practice settings with the use of a tool in the EHR. A weekly report from the 
EHR was run by a technician to gather intervention data, identify reimbursable 
opportunities, and document and bill via a separate Internet-based medication 
therapy management platform.
EVALUATION: The success of the new documentation workflow was evaluated, and 
continuous feedback was gathered from the pharmacists and the billing 
technician. Updates were provided to the ambulatory clinical pharmacist at 
monthly staff meetings and workflow changes implemented as needed.
RESULTS: A total of 5210 interventions were documented by the pharmacists in 
various intervention categories. The 3 most common intervention categories 
included patient and medication education (1765), medication reconciliations 
(1170), and compliance assessments (795).
CONCLUSION: A standardized documentation workflow allowed for consistent 
tracking of interventions across ambulatory care clinics and a TOC service. Key 
elements to the successful implementation of this new documentation workflow 
included proper training and continuous feedback to the ambulatory clinical 
pharmacists, assistance from a billing technician, and consistent documentation 
by the ambulatory clinical pharmacists.
