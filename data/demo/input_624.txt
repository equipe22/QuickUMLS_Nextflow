Secondary use of large and open data sets provides researchers with an 
opportunity to address high-impact questions that would otherwise be 
prohibitively expensive and time consuming to study. Despite the availability of 
data, generating hypotheses from huge data sets is often challenging, and the 
lack of complex analysis of data might lead to weak hypotheses. To overcome 
these issues and to assist researchers in building hypotheses from raw data, we 
are working on a visual and analytical platform called PRD Pivot. PRD Pivot is a 
de-identified pediatric research database designed to make secondary use of rich 
data sources, such as the electronic health record (EHR). The development of 
visual analytics using Microsoft Live Labs Pivot makes the process of data 
elaboration, information gathering, knowledge generation, and complex 
information exploration transparent to tool users and provides researchers with 
the ability to sort and filter by various criteria, which can lead to strong, 
novel hypotheses.
