An Unsupervised Graph Based Continuous Word Representation Method for Biomedical 
Text Mining.

Jiang Z, Li L, Huang D.

In biomedical text mining tasks, distributed word representation has succeeded 
in capturing semantic regularities, but most of them are shallow-window based 
models, which are not sufficient for expressing the meaning of words. To 
represent words using deeper information, we make explicit the semantic 
regularity to emerge in word relations, including dependency relations and 
context relations, and propose a novel architecture for computing continuous 
vector representation by leveraging those relations. The performance of our 
model is measured on word analogy task and Protein-Protein Interaction 
Extraction (PPIE) task. Experimental results show that our method performs 
overall better than other word representation models on word analogy task and 
have many advantages on biomedical text mining.
