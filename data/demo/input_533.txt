In this article, we present a dataset containing word embeddings and document 
topic distribution vectors generated from MOOCs video lecture transcripts. 
Transcripts of 12,032 video lectures from 200 courses were collected from 
Coursera learning platform. This large corpus of transcripts was used as input 
to two well-known NLP techniques, namely Word2Vec and Latent Dirichlet 
Allocation (LDA) to generate word embeddings and topic vectors, respectively. We 
used Word2Vec and LDA implementation in the Gensim package in Python. The data 
presented in this article are related to the research article entitled 
"Integrating word embeddings and document topics with deep learning in a video 
classification framework" [1]. The dataset is hosted in the Mendeley Data 
repository [2].
