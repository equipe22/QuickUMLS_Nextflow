VetCompass Australia is veterinary medical records-based research coordinated 
with the global VetCompass endeavor to maximize its quality and effectiveness 
for Australian companion animals (cats, dogs, and horses). Bringing together all 
seven Australian veterinary schools, it is the first nationwide surveillance 
system collating clinical records on companion-animal diseases and treatments. 
VetCompass data service collects and aggregates real-time, clinical records for 
researchers to interrogate, delivering sustainable and cost-effective access to 
data from hundreds of veterinary practitioners nationwide. Analysis of these 
clinical records will reveal geographical and temporal trends in the prevalence 
of inherited and acquired diseases, identify frequently prescribed treatments, 
revolutionize clinical auditing, help the veterinary profession to rank research 
priorities, and assure evidence-based companion-animal curricula in veterinary 
schools. VetCompass Australia will progress in three phases: (1) roll-out of the 
VetCompass platform to harvest Australian veterinary clinical record data; (2) 
development and enrichment of the coding (data-presentation) platform; and (3) 
creation of a world-first, real-time surveillance interface with natural 
language processing (NLP) technology. The first of these three phases is 
described in the current article. Advances in the collection and sharing of 
records from numerous practices will enable veterinary professionals to deliver 
a vastly improved level of care for companion animals that will improve their 
quality of life.
