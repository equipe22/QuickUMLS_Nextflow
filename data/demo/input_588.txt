INTRODUCTION: The widespread adoption of electronic health records (EHR) 
provides a new opportunity to improve the efficiency of clinical research. The 
European EHR4CR (Electronic Health Records for Clinical Research) 4-year project 
has developed an innovative technological platform to enable the re-use of EHR 
data for clinical research. The objective of this cost-benefit assessment (CBA) 
is to assess the value of EHR4CR solutions compared to current practices, from 
the perspective of sponsors of clinical trials.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A CBA model was developed using an advanced modeling 
approach. The costs of performing three clinical research scenarios (S) applied 
to a hypothetical Phase II or III oncology clinical trial workflow (reference 
case) were estimated under current and EHR4CR conditions, namely protocol 
feasibility assessment (S1), patient identification for recruitment (S2), and 
clinical study execution (S3). The potential benefits were calculated 
considering that the estimated reduction in actual person-time and costs for 
performing EHR4CR S1, S2, and S3 would accelerate time to market (TTM). 
Probabilistic sensitivity analyses using Monte Carlo simulations were conducted 
to manage uncertainty.
RESULTS: Should the estimated efficiency gains achieved with the EHR4CR platform 
translate into faster TTM, the expected benefits for the global pharmaceutical 
oncology sector were estimated at €161.5m (S1), €45.7m (S2), €204.5m (S1+S2), 
€1906m (S3), and up to €2121.8m (S1+S2+S3) when the scenarios were used 
sequentially.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that optimizing clinical trial design and 
execution with the EHR4CR platform would generate substantial added value for 
pharmaceutical industry, as main sponsors of clinical trials in Europe, and 
beyond.
