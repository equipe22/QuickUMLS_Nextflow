The Quality Data Model (QDM) is an established standard for representing 
electronic clinical quality measures on electronic health record (EHR) 
repositories. The Informatics for Integrated Biology and the Bedside (i2b2) is a 
widely used platform for implementing clinical data repositories. However, 
translation from QDM to i2b2 is challenging, since QDM allows for complex 
queries beyond the capability of single i2b2 messages. We have developed an 
approach to decompose complex QDM algorithms into workflows of single i2b2 
messages, and execute them on the KNIME data analytics platform. Each workflow 
operation module is composed of parameter lists, a template for the i2b2 
message, an mechanism to create parameter updates, and a web service call to 
i2b2. The communication between workflow modules relies on passing keys ofi2b2 
result sets. As a demonstration of validity, we describe the implementation and 
execution of a type 2 diabetes mellitus phenotype algorithm against an i2b2 data 
repository.
