OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to quantify the variability of language in 
free text reports of pulmonary embolus (PE) studies and to gauge the 
informativeness of free text to predict PE diagnosis using machine learning as 
proxy for human understanding.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: All 1,133 consecutive chest CTs with contrast studies 
performed under a PE protocol and ordered in the emergency department in 2016 
were selected from our departmental electronic workflow system. We used 
commercial text-mining and predictive analytics software to parse and describe 
all report text and to generate a suite of machine learning rules that sought to 
predict the "gold standard" radiological diagnosis of PE.
RESULTS: There was extensive variation in the length of Findings section and 
Impression section texts across the reports, only marginally associated with a 
positive PE diagnosis. A marked concentration of terms was found: for example, 
20 words were used in the Findings section of 93% of the reports, and 896 of 
2,296 distinct words were each used in only one report's Impression section. In 
the validation set, machine learning rules had perfect sensitivity but imperfect 
specificity, a low positive predictive value of 73%, and a misclassification 
rate of 3%.
CONCLUSION: Use of free text reporting was associated with extensive variability 
in report length and report terms used. Interpretation of the free text was a 
difficult machine learning task and suggests potential difficulty for human 
recipients in fully understanding such reports. These results support the 
prospective assessment of the impact of a fully structured report template with 
at least some mandatory discrete fields on ease of use of reports and their 
understanding.
