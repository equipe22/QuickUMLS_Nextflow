Postmarketing drug surveillance is critical to assessing adverse events 
associated with medications, because prelaunch clinical trials frequently miss 
negative drug effects. The Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside 
platform (i2b2) has been used effectively for this. However, previous work 
suffers from incomplete medical data present in electronic health record (EHR) 
systems. Here, we develop a system to integrate non-traditional data sources 
with EHR data: pharmacy dispensing information and patient-reported data. We 
implement and validate a toolset to gather medication data from a Pharmacy 
Benefit Manager network, import it into an i2b2 EHR repository using a standard 
data format, merge it with the EHR data, and present it to for annotation with 
results returned to i2b2. This toolkit is enabling studies on medication list 
data quality, adherence, and adverse event detection.
