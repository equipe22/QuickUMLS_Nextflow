BioC is a new format and associated code libraries for sharing text and 
annotations. We have implemented BioC natural language preprocessing pipelines 
in two popular programming languages: C++ and Java. The current implementations 
interface with the well-known MedPost and Stanford natural language processing 
tool sets. The pipeline functionality includes sentence segmentation, 
tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, lemmatization and sentence parsing. These 
pipelines can be easily integrated along with other BioC programs into any BioC 
compliant text mining systems. As an application, we converted the NCBI disease 
corpus to BioC format, and the pipelines have successfully run on this corpus to 
demonstrate their functionality. Code and data can be downloaded from 
http://bioc.sourceforge.net. Database URL: http://bioc.sourceforge.net.
