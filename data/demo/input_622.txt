While genomic data is frequently collected under distinct research protocols and 
disparate clinical and research regimes, there is a benefit in streamlining 
sequencing strategies to create harmonized databases, particularly in the area 
of pediatric rare disease. Research hospitals seeking to implement unified 
genomics workflows for research and clinical practice face numerous challenges, 
as they need to address the unique requirements and goals of the distinct 
environments and many stakeholders, including clinicians, researchers and 
sequencing providers. Here, we present outcomes of the first phase of the 
Children's Rare Disease Cohorts initiative (CRDC) that was completed at Boston 
Children's Hospital (BCH). We have developed a broadly sharable database of 2441 
exomes from 15 pediatric rare disease cohorts, with major contributions from 
early onset epilepsy and early onset inflammatory bowel disease. All sequencing 
data is integrated and combined with phenotypic and research data in a genomics 
learning system (GLS). Phenotypes were both manually annotated and pulled 
automatically from patient medical records. Deployment of a genomically-ordered 
relational database allowed us to provide a modular and robust platform for 
centralized storage and analysis of research and clinical data, currently 
totaling 8516 exomes and 112 genomes. The GLS integrates analytical systems, 
including machine learning algorithms for automated variant classification and 
prioritization, as well as phenotype extraction via natural language processing 
(NLP) of clinical notes. This GLS is extensible to additional analytic systems 
and growing research and clinical collections of genomic and other types of 
data.
