BACKGROUND: Most existing systems that identify protein-protein interaction 
(PPI) in literature make decisions solely on evidence within a single sentence 
and ignore the rich context of PPI descriptions in large corpora. Moreover, they 
often suffer from the heavy burden of manual annotation.
METHODS: To address these problems, a new relational-similarity (RS)-based 
approach exploiting context in large-scale text is proposed. A basic RS model is 
first established to make initial predictions. Then word similarity matrices 
that are sensitive to the PPI identification task are constructed using a 
corpus-based approach. Finally, a hybrid model is developed to integrate the 
word similarity model with the basic RS model.
RESULTS: The experimental results show that the basic RS model achieves F-scores 
much higher than a baseline of random guessing on interactions (from 50.6% to 
75.0%) and non-interactions (from 49.4% to 74.2%). The hybrid model further 
improves F-score by about 2% on interactions and 3% on non-interactions.
CONCLUSION: The experimental evaluations conducted with PPIs in well-known 
databases showed the effectiveness of our approach that explores context 
information in PPI identification. This investigation confirmed that within the 
framework of relational similarity, the word similarity model relieves the data 
sparseness problem in similarity calculation.
