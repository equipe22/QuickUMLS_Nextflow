Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems provide the kernel application of health 
information systems and health networks which should be independent of 
complexity, localisation constraints, platforms, protocols, etc. Based on shared 
care information systems' requirements for high level interoperability, a 
generic component architecture has been introduced. For implementing, running 
and maintaining acceptable and useable health information systems components, 
all views of the ISO Reference Model-Open Distributed Processing have to be 
considered. Following the Model Driven Architecture paradigm, a reference model 
as well as concept-representing domain models both independent of platforms must 
be specified, which are combined and harmonised as well as automatically 
transferred into platform-specific models using appropriate tools.
