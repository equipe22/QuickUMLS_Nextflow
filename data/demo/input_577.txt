Integration profiles collaboratively developed by CDISC and IHE for integrating 
data from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) with clinical research and 
pharmacovigilance are limited to resolving lexical/syntactic data integration 
issues and do not address semantic barriers. This paper describes the 
collaboration between two European projects - EHR4CR and SALUS - in implementing 
ISO/IEC 11179-based metadata registries (MDRs) and semantically integrated 
cross-platform data access. A common "semantic MDR" provides a framework for 
bidirectional/cross-MDR mapping and federated queries are enabled using the 
newly-defined IHE Data Exchange (DEX) profile. In the pilot implementation, 
mappings for 178 EHR4CR and 199 SALUS metadata elements were persisted in the 
semantic MDR. The DEX profile was then used to access semantically equivalent 
data elements in SALUS or EHR4CR participating EHR systems. ISO/IEC 11179-based 
MDRs and DEX integration profile address the goal of developing pan-EU 
computable semantic integration of data from clinical care, clinical research, 
and patient safety platforms.
