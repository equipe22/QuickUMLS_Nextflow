The European Federation for Medical Informatics (EFMI) held its Special Topic 
Conference (STC) in October 2017 in Israel. EFMI holds STC's to focus on a 
particular issue, whereas its major annual conference Medical Informatics Europe 
(MIE) has a much wider remit. This conference challenged the informatics 
community to engage patients in digital health. Examples of the gap in digital 
engagementfrom the conference contributions include: An app to connect parents 
to a paediatric emergency department was presented. We heard how comparisons 
between general practice and paediatrician led health systems were being 
compromised through the lack of available databases and that Europe needs a 
fit-for-purpose paediatric electronic health records (EHR). The public should be 
involved in shared EHR platform development. We were informedpatients preferred 
clinicians to use their mobile device and how the online community can be a 
source of research subjects. A visualisation tool is being developed to display 
data about attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). On a more sombre 
note the conference remembered Assa Reichert, a long standing member of EFMI. 
Notwithstanding our reflections on Assa's service to EFMI and informatics, this 
conference provide a real opportunity to explore how digital health might 
empower patients.
