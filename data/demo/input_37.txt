OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to review and visualize the medical 
informatics field over the previous 12 months according to the frequencies of 
keywords and topics in papers published in the top four journals in the field 
and in Healthcare Informatics Research (HIR), an official journal of the Korean 
Society of Medical Informatics.
METHODS: A six-person team conducted an extensive review of the literature on 
clinical and consumer informatics. The literature was searched using keywords 
employed in the American Medical Informatics Association year-in-review process 
and organized into 14 topics used in that process. Data were analyzed using word 
clouds, social network analysis, and association rules.
RESULTS: The literature search yielded 370 references and 1,123 unique keywords. 
'Electronic Health Record' (EHR) (78.6%) was the most frequently appearing 
keyword in the articles published in the five studied journals, followed by 
'telemedicine' (2.1%). EHR (37.6%) was also the most frequently studied topic 
area, followed by clinical informatics (12.0%). However, 'telemedicine' (17.0%) 
was the most frequently appearing keyword in articles published in HIR, followed 
by 'telecommunications' (4.5%). Telemedicine (47.1%) was the most frequently 
studied topic area, followed by EHR (14.7%).
CONCLUSIONS: The study findings reflect the Korean government's efforts to 
introduce telemedicine into the Korean healthcare system and reactions to this 
from the stakeholders associated with telemedicine.
