Electronic clinical quality measures (eCQMs) based on the Quality Data Model 
(QDM) cannot currently be executed against non-standardized electronic health 
record (EHR) data. To address this gap, we prototyped an implementation of a 
QDM-based eCQM using KNIME, an open-source platform comprising a wide array of 
computational workflow tools that are collectively capable of executing 
QDM-based logic, while also giving users the flexibility to customize mappings 
from site-specific EHR data. To prototype this capability, we implemented eCQM 
CMS30 (titled: Statin Prescribed at Discharge) using KNIME. The implementation 
contains value set modules with connections to the National Library of 
Medicine's Value Set Authority Center, QDM Data Elements that can query a local 
EHR database, and logical and temporal operators. We successfully executed the 
KNIME implementation of CMS30 using data from the Vanderbilt University and 
Northwestern University EHR systems.
