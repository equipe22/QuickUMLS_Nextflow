In his 2004 State of the Union Address, President Bush called for the adoption 
of the electronic health record (EHR) to increase efficiency and improve the 
quality of healthcare. This system could reduce healthcare costs by 20 percent 
or more per year. Some of those savings would be attributed to a dramatic 
reduction in losses due to fraud. Though IT by itself cannot solve the problem 
of healthcare fraud, developing an interoperable National Health Information 
Network (NHIN) can provide a platform to implement real-time anti-fraud 
controls. In this paper we inventory the costs and benefits of fraud detection 
from the NHIN and conclude that such an infrastructure investment has the 
potential to produce significant national savings.
