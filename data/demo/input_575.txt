PURPOSE: Geisinger Health System (GHS) provides an ideal platform for Precision 
Medicine. Key elements are the integrated health system, stable patient 
population, and electronic health record (EHR) infrastructure. In 2007, 
Geisinger launched MyCode, a system-wide biobanking program to link samples and 
EHR data for broad research use.
METHODS: Patient-centered input into MyCode was obtained using participant focus 
groups. Participation in MyCode is based on opt-in informed consent and allows 
recontact, which facilitates collection of data not in the EHR and, since 2013, 
the return of clinically actionable results to participants. MyCode leverages 
Geisinger's technology and clinical infrastructure for participant tracking and 
sample collection.
RESULTS: MyCode has a consent rate of >85%, with more than 90,000 participants 
currently and with ongoing enrollment of ~4,000 per month. MyCode samples have 
been used to generate molecular data, including high-density genotype and exome 
sequence data. Genotype and EHR-derived phenotype data replicate previously 
reported genetic associations.
CONCLUSION: The MyCode project has created resources that enable a new model for 
translational research that is faster, more flexible, and more cost-effective 
than traditional clinical research approaches. The new model is scalable and 
will increase in value as these resources grow and are adopted across multiple 
research platforms.Genet Med 18 9, 906-913.
