BACKGROUND: Electronic medical record (EMR) systems have become widely used 
throughout the world to improve the quality of healthcare and the efficiency of 
hospital services. A bilingual medical lexicon of Chinese and English is needed 
to meet the demand for the multi-lingual and multi-national treatment. We make 
efforts to extract a bilingual lexicon from English and Chinese discharge 
summaries with a small seed lexicon. The lexical terms can be classified into 
two categories: single-word terms (SWTs) and multi-word terms (MWTs). For SWTs, 
we use a label propagation (LP; context-based) method to extract candidates of 
translation pairs. For MWTs, which are pervasive in the medical domain, we 
propose a term alignment method, which firstly obtains translation candidates 
for each component word of a Chinese MWT, and then generates their combinations, 
from which the system selects a set of plausible translation candidates.
RESULTS: We compare our LP method with a baseline method based on simple 
context-similarity. The LP based method outperforms the baseline with the 
accuracies: 4.44% Acc1, 24.44% Acc10, and 62.22% Acc100, where AccN means the 
top N accuracy. The accuracy of the LP method drops to 5.41% Acc10 and 8.11% 
Acc20 for MWTs. Our experiments show that the method based on term alignment 
improves the performance for MWTs to 16.22% Acc10 and 27.03% Acc20.
CONCLUSIONS: We constructed a framework for building an English-Chinese term 
dictionary from discharge summaries in the two languages. Our experiments have 
shown that the LP-based method augmented with the term alignment method will 
contribute to reduction of manual work required to compile a bilingual 
sydictionary of clinical terms.
