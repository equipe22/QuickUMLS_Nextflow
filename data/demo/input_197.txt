Biomedical Natural Language Processing (BioNLP) attempts to capture biomedical 
phenomena from texts by extracting relations between biomedical entities (i.e. 
proteins and genes). Traditionally, only binary relations have been extracted 
from large numbers of published papers. Recently, more complex relations 
(biomolecular events) have also been extracted. Such events may include several 
entities or other relations. To evaluate the performance of the text mining 
systems, several shared task challenges have been arranged for the BioNLP 
community. With a common and consistent task setting, the BioNLP'09 shared task 
evaluated complex biomolecular events such as binding and regulation.Finding 
these events automatically is important in order to improve biomedical event 
extraction systems. In the present paper, we propose an automatic event 
extraction system, which contains a model for complex events, by solving a 
classification problem with rich features. The main contributions of the present 
paper are: (1) the proposal of an effective bio-event detection method using 
machine learning, (2) provision of a high-performance event extraction system, 
and (3) the execution of a quantitative error analysis. The proposed complex 
(binding and regulation) event detector outperforms the best system from the 
BioNLP'09 shared task challenge.
