StudyPortal was implemented as the first multilingual search platform for 
geographic visualization of clinical trials and scientific articles. The 
platform queries information from ClinicalTrials.gov, PubMed, a geodatabase and 
geographic maps to enable geospatial study search and real-time rendering of 
study locations or research networks on a map. Thus, disease-specific clinical 
studies or whole research networks can be shown in a geographic proximity. 
Moreover, a semantic layer enables multilingual disease input and autosuggestion 
of medical terms based on the Unified Medical Language System. The portal is 
accessible on https://studyportal.uni-muenster.de. This paper presents details 
on implementation of the novel search platform, its search evaluation and future 
work.
