Enabling clinical decision support (CDS) across multiple electronic health 
record (EHR) systems has been a desired but largely unattained aim of clinical 
informatics, especially in commercial EHR systems. A potential opportunity for 
enabling such scalable CDS is to leverage vendor-supported, Web-based CDS 
development platforms along with vendor-supported application programming 
interfaces (APIs). Here, we propose a potential staged approach for enabling 
such scalable CDS, starting with the use of custom EHR APIs and moving towards 
standardized EHR APIs to facilitate interoperability. We analyzed three 
commercial EHR systems for their capabilities to support the proposed approach, 
and we implemented prototypes in all three systems. Based on these analyses and 
prototype implementations, we conclude that the approach proposed is feasible, 
already supported by several major commercial EHR vendors, and potentially 
capable of enabling cross-platform CDS at scale.
