The notion of context has been widely studied and there are several authors that 
have proposed different definitions of context. However, context has not been 
widely studied in the framework of human mobility and the notion of context has 
been imported directly from other computing fields without specifically 
addressing the tourism domain requirements. In order to store and manage context 
information a context data model and a context management platform are needed. 
Ontologies have been widely used in context modelling, but many of them are 
designed to be applied in general ubiquitous computing environments, do not 
contain specific concepts related to the tourism domain or some approaches do 
not contain enough concepts to represent context information related to the 
visitor on the move. That is why we propose a new approach to provide a better 
solution to model context data in tourism environments, adding more value to our 
solution reusing data about tourist resources from an Open Data repository and 
publishing it as Linked Data. We also propose the architecture for a context 
information management platform based on this context data model.
