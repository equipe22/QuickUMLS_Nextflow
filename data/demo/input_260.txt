The authors report on the development of the Cancer Tissue Information 
Extraction System (caTIES)--an application that supports collaborative tissue 
banking and text mining by leveraging existing natural language processing 
methods and algorithms, grid communication and security frameworks, and query 
visualization methods. The system fills an important need for text-derived 
clinical data in translational research such as tissue-banking and clinical 
trials. The design of caTIES addresses three critical issues for informatics 
support of translational research: (1) federation of research data sources 
derived from clinical systems; (2) expressive graphical interfaces for 
concept-based text mining; and (3) regulatory and security model for supporting 
multi-center collaborative research. Implementation of the system at several 
Cancer Centers across the country is creating a potential network of caTIES 
repositories that could provide millions of de-identified clinical reports to 
users. The system provides an end-to-end application of medical natural language 
processing to support multi-institutional translational research programs.
