A number of computational measures for determining semantic similarity between 
pairs of biomedical concepts have been developed using various standards and 
programming platforms. In this paper, we introduce two new open-source 
frameworks based on the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). These frameworks 
consist of the UMLS-Similarity and UMLS-Interface packages. UMLS-Interface 
provides path information about UMLS concepts. UMLS-Similarity calculates the 
semantic similarity between UMLS concepts using several previously developed 
measures and can be extended to include new measures. We validate the 
functionality of these frameworks by reproducing the results from previous work. 
Our frameworks constitute a significant contribution to the field of biomedical 
Natural Language Processing by providing a common development and testing 
platform for semantic similarity measures based on the UMLS.
