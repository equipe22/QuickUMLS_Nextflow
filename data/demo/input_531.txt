OBJECTIVES: The recent evolution of mobile devices has opened new possibilities 
of providing strongly integrated mobile services in healthcare. The objective of 
this paper is to describe the decision driver, development, and implementation 
of an integrated mobile Electronic Health Record (EHR) application at Ulsan 
University Hospital. This application helps healthcare providers view patients' 
medical records and information without a stationary computer workstation.
METHODS: We developed an integrated mobile application prototype that aimed to 
improve the mobility and usability of healthcare providers during their daily 
medical activities. The Android and iOS platform was used to create the mobile 
EHR application. The first working version was completed in 5 months and 
required 1,080 development hours.
RESULTS: The mobile EHR application provides patient vital signs, patient data, 
text communication, and integrated EHR. The application allows our healthcare 
providers to know the status of patients within and outside the hospital 
environment. The application provides a consistent user environment on several 
compatible Android and iOS devices. A group of 10 beta testers has consistently 
used and maintained our copy of the application, suggesting user acceptance.
CONCLUSIONS: We are developing the integrated mobile EHR application with the 
goals of implementing an environment that is user-friendly, implementing a 
patient-centered system, and increasing the hospital's competitiveness.
