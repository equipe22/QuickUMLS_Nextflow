For more than a decade, the eHealth initiative has been a government concern of 
many countries. In an Electronic Health Record (EHR) System, there is a need for 
sharing the data with a group of specialists simultaneously. Collaborative 
platforms alone are just a part of a solution, while a collaborative platform 
with parallel editing capabilities and with synchronized data streaming are 
stringently needed. In this paper, the design and implementation of a 
collaborative platform used in healthcare is introduced by describing the high 
level architecture and its implementation. A series of eHealth services are 
identified and usage examples in a healthcare environment are given.
