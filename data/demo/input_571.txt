BACKGROUND: Understanding the potential impact of cocaine use on health is 
increasingly important as cocaine use rises in the U.S.
OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the associations of regular cocaine use, with 
and without tobacco co-use, with cardiovascular and respiratory outcomes.
METHODS: Analysis of a limited dataset obtained through IBM Watson Health 
Explorys, a platform integrating electronic health record data. Matched controls 
were defined for: 1) cocaine-using patients (n = 8244; 44 % female); and 
subgroups of cocaine-using patients: 2) with an encounter diagnosis for tobacco 
use disorder (TUD; n = 4706); and 3) without a TUD diagnosis (non-TUD; n = 
3538). Patients had at least one documented medical evaluation in the 
MetroHealth System (Cleveland, Ohio). Cocaine-using patients had an encounter 
diagnosis of cocaine abuse/dependence and/or ≥2 cocaine-positive drug screens. 
Control patients, with no documented cocaine-use, were matched to the 
cocaine-using patients on demographics, residential zip code median income, body 
mass index, and, for the total sample, TUD-status. Outcomes were encounter 
diagnosis (yes/no) of cerebrovascular accident, heart arrhythmia, myocardial 
infarction, subarachnoid hemorrhage, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD), pneumonia, and all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: TUD-patients had the greatest prevalence of cardiovascular and 
respiratory disease, regardless of cocaine-use indication. In the total sample, 
TUD, and non-TUD subgroups, regular cocaine use was significantly associated 
with greater risk for cerebrovascular accident, arrhythmia, myocardial 
infarction, asthma, COPD, pneumonia and mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Cocaine use is associated with significantly greater risk of 
adverse cardiovascular and respiratory diagnoses and all-cause mortality.
