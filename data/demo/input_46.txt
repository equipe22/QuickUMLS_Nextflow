MOTIVATION: Numerous experimental and computational studies in the biomedical 
literature have provided considerable amounts of data on diverse RNA-RNA 
interactions (RRIs). However, few text mining systems for RRIs information 
extraction are available.
RESULTS: RNA Interactome Scoper (RIscoper) represents the first tool for 
full-scale RNA interactome scanning and was developed for extracting RRIs from 
the literature based on the N-gram model. Notably, a reliable RRI corpus was 
integrated in RIscoper, and more than 13 300 manually curated sentences with RRI 
information were recruited. RIscoper allows users to upload full texts or 
abstracts, and provides an online search tool that is connected with PubMed 
(PMID and keyword input), and these capabilities are useful for biologists. 
RIscoper has a strong performance (90.4% precision and 93.9% recall), integrates 
natural language processing techniques and has a reliable RRI corpus.
AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The standalone software and web server of 
RIscoper are freely available at www.rna-society.org/riscoper/.
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics 
online.
