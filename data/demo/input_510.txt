As health systems around the world turn towards highly distributed, specialized 
and cooperative structures to increase quality and safety of care as well as 
efficiency and efficacy of delivery processes, there is a growing need for 
supporting communication and collaboration of all parties involved with advanced 
ICT solutions. The Electronic Health Record (EHR) provides the information 
platform which is maturing towards the eHealth core application. To meet the 
requirements for sustainable, semantically interoperable, and trustworthy EHR 
solutions, different standards and different national strategies have been 
established. The workshop summarizes the requirements for such advanced EHR 
systems and their underlying architecture, presents different strategies and 
solutions advocated by corresponding protagonists, discusses pros and cons as 
well as harmonization and migration strategies for those approaches. It 
particularly highlights a turn towards ontology-driven architectures. The 
workshop is a joint activity of the EFMI Working Groups "Electronic Health 
Records" and "Security, Safety and Ethics".
