Today we have access to more than 1500 molecular database systems inside the 
internet. Based on these databases and information systems, computer scientists 
developed and implemented different methods for the automatic integration and 
prediction of biological networks. The idea is to use such methods for the 
automatic prediction and expansion of rudimentary molecular knowledge. However, 
the inherent data deficiency problem concerning the properties of specialized 
network hampers the database- and text-mining-based network construction. This 
paper presents the concept concerning the computational network expansion, 
namely for the specific biological network-thiol-disulfide redox regulatory 
network. Besides, a network-contexted document retrieval system (ncDocReSy) is 
also introduced to assist the network reduction by providing indirectly relevant 
literature for user's manual curation. NcDocReSy combines literature search with 
biological network and ranks the retrieved literature according to the network 
topology. NcDocReSy is implemented as a Cytoscape plugin.
