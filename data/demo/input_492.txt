The increasing use of microarray technologies brought about a parallel demand in 
methods for the functional interpretation of the results. Beyond the 
conventional functional annotations for genes, such as gene ontology, pathways, 
etc. other sources of information are still to be exploited. Text-mining methods 
allow extracting informative terms (bioentities) with different functional, 
chemical, clinical, etc. meanings, that can be associated to genes. We show how 
to use these associations within an appropriate statistical framework and how to 
apply them through easy-to-use, web-based environments to the functional 
interpretation of microarray experiments. Functional enrichment and gene set 
enrichment tests using bioentities are presented.
