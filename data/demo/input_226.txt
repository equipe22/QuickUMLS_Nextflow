We have developed a Decision Support Environment (DSE) for medical experts at 
the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The DSE contains two integrated 
systems: The Event-based Text-mining of Health Electronic Records (ETHER) and 
the Pattern-based and Advanced Network Analyzer for Clinical Evaluation and 
Assessment (PANACEA). These systems assist medical experts in reviewing reports 
submitted to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) and the FDA 
Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). In this manuscript, we describe the DSE 
architecture and key functionalities, and examine its potential contributions to 
the signal management process by focusing on four use cases: the identification 
of missing cases from a case series, the identification of duplicate case 
reports, retrieving cases for a case series analysis, and community detection 
for signal identification and characterization.
