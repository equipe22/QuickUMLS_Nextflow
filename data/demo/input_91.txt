The Unstructured Information Management Architecture (UIMA) [1] framework is a 
growing platform for natural language processing (NLP) applications. However, 
such applications may be difficult for non-technical users deploy. This project 
presents a web-based framework that wraps UIMA-based annotator systems into a 
graphical user interface for researchers and clinicians, and a web service for 
developers. An annotator that extracts data elements from lung cancer radiology 
reports is presented to illustrate the use of the system. Annotation results 
from the web system can be exported to multiple formats for users to utilize in 
other aspects of their research and workflow. This project demonstrates the 
benefits of a lay-user interface for complex NLP applications. Efforts such as 
this can lead to increased interest and support for NLP work in the clinical 
domain.
