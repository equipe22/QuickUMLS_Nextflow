With government stimulus money becoming available to encourage healthcare 
facilities to adopt electronic health record (EHR) systems, the decision to move 
forward with implementing an EHR system has taken on an urgency not previously 
seen. The EHR landscape is evolving rapidly and the underlying technology 
platform is becoming increasingly interconnected. One must make sure that an EHR 
decision does not lock oneself into technology obsolescence. The best approach 
for evaluating an EHR is on the basis of:usability, interoperability, and 
affordability.
