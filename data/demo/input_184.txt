OBJECTIVE: To create an analytics platform for specifying and detecting clinical 
phenotypes and other derived variables in electronic health record (EHR) data 
for quality improvement investigations.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We have developed an architecture for an Analytic 
Information Warehouse (AIW). It supports transforming data represented in 
different physical schemas into a common data model, specifying derived 
variables in terms of the common model to enable their reuse, computing derived 
variables while enforcing invariants and ensuring correctness and consistency of 
data transformations, long-term curation of derived data, and export of derived 
data into standard analysis tools. It includes software that implements these 
features and a computing environment that enables secure high-performance access 
to and processing of large datasets extracted from EHRs.
RESULTS: We have implemented and deployed the architecture in production 
locally. The software is available as open source. We have used it as part of 
hospital operations in a project to reduce rates of hospital readmission within 
30days. The project examined the association of over 100 derived variables 
representing disease and co-morbidity phenotypes with readmissions in 5years of 
data from our institution's clinical data warehouse and the UHC Clinical 
Database (CDB). The CDB contains administrative data from over 200 hospitals 
that are in academic medical centers or affiliated with such centers.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: A widely available platform for managing and 
detecting phenotypes in EHR data could accelerate the use of such data in 
quality improvement and comparative effectiveness studies.
