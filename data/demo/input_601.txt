BACKGROUND: Interoperable phenotyping algorithms, needed to identify patient 
cohorts meeting eligibility criteria for observational studies or clinical 
trials, require medical data in a consistent structured, coded format. Data 
heterogeneity limits such algorithms' applicability. Existing approaches are 
often: not widely interoperable; or, have low sensitivity due to reliance on the 
lowest common denominator (ICD-9 diagnoses). In the Scalable Collaborative 
Infrastructure for a Learning Healthcare System (SCILHS) we endeavor to use the 
widely-available Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) procedure codes with 
ICD-9. Unfortunately, CPT changes drastically year-to-year - codes are 
retired/replaced. Longitudinal analysis requires grouping retired and current 
codes. BioPortal provides a navigable CPT hierarchy, which we imported into the 
Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2) data warehouse and 
analytics platform. However, this hierarchy does not include retired codes.
METHODS: We compared BioPortal's 2014AA CPT hierarchy with Partners Healthcare's 
SCILHS datamart, comprising three-million patients' data over 15 years. 573 CPT 
codes were not present in 2014AA (6.5 million occurrences). No existing 
terminology provided hierarchical linkages for these missing codes, so we 
developed a method that automatically places missing codes in the most specific 
"grouper" category, using the numerical similarity of CPT codes. Two 
informaticians reviewed the results. We incorporated the final table into our 
i2b2 SCILHS/PCORnet ontology, deployed it at seven sites, and performed a gap 
analysis and an evaluation against several phenotyping algorithms.
RESULTS: The reviewers found the method placed the code correctly with 97 % 
precision when considering only miscategorizations ("correctness precision") and 
52 % precision using a gold-standard of optimal placement ("optimality 
precision"). High correctness precision meant that codes were placed in a 
reasonable hierarchal position that a reviewer can quickly validate. Lower 
optimality precision meant that codes were not often placed in the optimal 
hierarchical subfolder. The seven sites encountered few occurrences of codes 
outside our ontology, 93 % of which comprised just four codes. Our hierarchical 
approach correctly grouped retired and non-retired codes in most cases and 
extended the temporal reach of several important phenotyping algorithms.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed a simple, easily-validated, automated method to place 
retired CPT codes into the BioPortal CPT hierarchy. This complements existing 
hierarchical terminologies, which do not include retired codes. The approach's 
utility is confirmed by the high correctness precision and successful grouping 
of retired with non-retired codes.
