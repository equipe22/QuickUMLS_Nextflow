Generating high quality gene clusters and identifying the underlying biological 
mechanism of the gene clusters are the important goals of clustering gene 
expression analysis. Based on this consideration, we design and develop a 
unified system Gene Expression Miner (GE-Miner) by integrating cluster ensemble, 
text clustering and multidocument summarisation and provide an environment for 
comprehensive gene expression data analysis. Experimental results demonstrate 
that our systems can obtain high quality clusters and provide concise and 
informative textual summary for the gene clusters.
