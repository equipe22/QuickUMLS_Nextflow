OBJECTIVES: This article describes the Web application framework for Electronic 
Health Records (EHRs) we have developed to reduce construction costs for EHR 
sytems.
METHODS: The openEHR project has developed clinical model driven architecture 
for future-proof interoperable EHR systems. This project provides the 
specifications to standardize clinical domain model implementations, upon which 
the ISO/CEN 13606 standards are based. The reference implementation has been 
formally described in Eiffel. Moreover C# and Java implementations have been 
developed as reference. While scripting languages had been more popular because 
of their higher efficiency and faster development in recent years, they had not 
been involved in the openEHR implementations. From 2007, we have used the Ruby 
language and Ruby on Rails (RoR) as an agile development platform to implement 
EHR systems, which is in conformity with the openEHR specifications.
RESULTS: We implemented almost all of the specifications, the Archetype 
Definition Language parser, and RoR scaffold generator from archetype. Although 
some problems have emerged, most of them have been resolved.
CONCLUSIONS: We have provided an agile EHR Web framework, which can build up Web 
systems from archetype models using RoR. The feasibility of the archetype model 
to provide semantic interoperability of EHRs has been demonstrated and we have 
verified that that it is suitable for the construction of EHR systems.
