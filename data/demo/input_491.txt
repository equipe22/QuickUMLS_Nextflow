Natural Language Understanding (NLU) is a rapidly growing field in medical 
informatics. Its potential for tomorrow's applications is important. However, it 
is limited by its ability to ground its components on a solid model of the 
domain. This opens the way for the emergence of the discipline of medical domain 
modelling, as part of the vast field of Knowledge Base (KB) engineering. This 
article aims at describing the current development of a multilingual natural 
language system, strongly oriented towards the semantics of the domain. Special 
emphasis is presently given to the task of building a domain model, and to 
establish direct links with the language platform. The result is a model-driven 
NLU system. Numerous benefits are expected in the long term.
