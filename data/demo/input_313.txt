Use of medical terminologies and mappings across them are considered to be 
crucial pre-requisites for achieving interoperable eHealth applications. Built 
upon the outcomes of several research projects, we introduce a framework for 
evaluating and utilizing terminology mappings that offers a platform for i) 
performing various mappings strategies, ii) representing terminology mappings 
together with their provenance information, and iii) enabling terminology 
reasoning for inferring both new and erroneous mappings. We present the results 
of the introduced framework from SALUS project where we evaluated the quality of 
both existing and inferred terminology mappings among standard terminologies.
