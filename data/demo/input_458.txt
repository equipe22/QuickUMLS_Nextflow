The X-rudder concept has been applied to more and more autonomous underwater 
vehicles (AUVs) in recent years, since it shows better maneuverability and 
robustness against rudder failure compared to the traditional cruciform rudder. 
Aiming at the fault-tolerant control of the X-rudder AUV (hereinafter 
abbreviated as xAUV), a fault-tolerant steering prototype system which can 
realize dynamics control, autonomous rudder fault detection and fault-tolerant 
control is presented in this paper. The steering prototype system is deployed on 
a verification platform, an xAUV, in which the monitor software is developed 
based on the factory method and the onboard software is developed based on the 
finite state machine (FSM). Dual-loop increment feedback control (DIFC) is first 
introduced to obtain smooth virtual rudder commands considering actuator's 
limitations. Then the virtual rudder commands are transformed into X-rudder 
commands based on the mapping theory. In rudder fault diagnosis, an optimized 
particle filter is proposed for estimating rudder effect deduction, with 
proposal distribution derived from unscented Kalman filter (UKF). Then the fault 
type can be determined by analyzing indicators related to the deduction. 
Fault-tolerant control is addressed by dealing with nonlinear programming (NLP) 
problem, where minimization of allocation errors and control efforts are set as 
the optimization objectives, and rudder failure, saturation and actuators 
limitations are considered as constraints. The fixed-point iteration method is 
utilized to solve this optimization problem. Many field tests have been 
conducted in towing tank. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed 
steering prototype system is able to detect rudder faults and is robust against 
rudder failure.
