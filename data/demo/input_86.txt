BACKGROUND: We present a text-mining tool for recognizing biomedical entities in 
scientific literature. OGER++ is a hybrid system for named entity recognition 
and concept recognition (linking), which combines a dictionary-based annotator 
with a corpus-based disambiguation component. The annotator uses an efficient 
look-up strategy combined with a normalization method for matching spelling 
variants. The disambiguation classifier is implemented as a feed-forward neural 
network which acts as a postfilter to the previous step.
RESULTS: We evaluated the system in terms of processing speed and annotation 
quality. In the speed benchmarks, the OGER++ web service processes 9.7 abstracts 
or 0.9 full-text documents per second. On the CRAFT corpus, we achieved 71.4% 
and 56.7% F1 for named entity recognition and concept recognition, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Combining knowledge-based and data-driven components allows 
creating a system with competitive performance in biomedical text mining.
