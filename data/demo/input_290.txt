PURPOSE: This article describes a formative natural language processing (NLP) 
system that is grounded in user-centered design, simplification, and 
transparency of function.
METHODS: The NLP system was tasked to classify diseases within patient discharge 
summaries and is evaluated against clinician judgment during the 2008 i2b2 
Shared Task competition. Text classification is performed by interactive, fully 
supervised learning using rule-based processes and support vector machines 
(SVMs).
RESULTS: The macro-averaged F-score for textual (t) and intuitive (i) 
classification were 0.614(t) and 0.629(i), while micro-averaged F-scores were 
recorded at 0.966(t) and 0.954(i) for the competition. These results were 
comparable to the top 10 performing systems.
DISCUSSION: The results of this study indicate that an interactive training 
method, de novo knowledge base with no external data sources, and simplified 
text mining processes can achieve a comparably high performance in classifying 
health-related texts. Further research is needed to determine if the 
user-centered advantages of a NLP system translate into real world benefits.
