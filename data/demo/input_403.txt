BACKGROUND: Near universal administration of vaccines mandates intense 
pharmacovigilance for vaccine safety and a stringently low tolerance for adverse 
events. Reports of autoimmune diseases (AID) following vaccination have been 
challenging to evaluate given the high rates of vaccination, background 
incidence of autoimmunity, and low incidence and variable times for onset of AID 
after vaccinations. In order to identify biologically plausible pathways to 
adverse autoimmune events of vaccine-related AID, we used a systems biology 
approach to create a matrix of innate and adaptive immune mechanisms active in 
specific diseases, responses to vaccine antigens, adjuvants, preservatives and 
stabilizers, for the most common vaccine-associated AID found in the Vaccine 
Adverse Event Reporting System.
RESULTS: This report focuses on Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS), Rheumatoid 
Arthritis (RA), Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), and Idiopathic (or immune) 
Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP). Multiple curated databases and automated text 
mining of PubMed literature identified 667 genes associated with RA, 448 with 
SLE, 49 with ITP and 73 with GBS. While all data sources provided valuable and 
unique gene associations, text mining using natural language processing (NLP) 
algorithms provided the most information but required curation to remove 
incorrect associations. Six genes were associated with all four AIDs. 
Thirty-three pathways were shared by the four AIDs. Classification of genes into 
twelve immune system related categories identified more "Th17 T-cell subtype" 
genes in RA than the other AIDs, and more "Chemokine plus Receptors" genes 
associated with RA than SLE. Gene networks were visualized and clustered into 
interconnected modules with specific gene clusters for each AID, including one 
in RA with ten C-X-C motif chemokines. The intersection of genes associated with 
GBS, GBS peptide auto-antigens, influenza A infection, and influenza vaccination 
created a subnetwork of genes that inferred a possible role for the MAPK 
signaling pathway in influenza vaccine related GBS.
CONCLUSIONS: Results showing unique and common gene sets, pathways, immune 
system categories and functional clusters of genes in four autoimmune diseases 
suggest it is possible to develop molecular classifications of autoimmune and 
inflammatory events. Combining this information with cellular and other disease 
responses should greatly aid in the assessment of potential immune-mediated 
adverse events following vaccination.
