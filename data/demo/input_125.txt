External content sources such as MEDLINE(®), National Institutes of Health (NIH) 
grants and conference websites provide access to the latest breaking biomedical 
information, which can inform pharmaceutical and biotechnology company pipeline 
decisions. The value of the sites for industry, however, is limited by the use 
of the public internet, the limited synonyms, the rarity of batch searching 
capability and the disconnected nature of the sites. Fortunately, many sites now 
offer their content for download and we have developed an automated internal 
workflow that uses text mining and tailored ontologies for programmatic search 
and knowledge extraction. We believe such an efficient and secure approach 
provides a competitive advantage to companies needing access to the latest 
information for a range of use cases and complements manually curated commercial 
sources.
