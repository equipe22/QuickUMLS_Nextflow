OBJECTIVE: Electronic health records linked with biorepositories are a powerful 
platform for translational studies. A major bottleneck exists in the ability to 
phenotype patients accurately and efficiently. The objective of this study was 
to develop an automated high-throughput phenotyping method integrating 
International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes and narrative data 
extracted using natural language processing (NLP).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed a mapping method for automatically 
identifying relevant ICD and NLP concepts for a specific phenotype leveraging 
the Unified Medical Language System. Along with health care utilization, 
aggregated ICD and NLP counts were jointly analyzed by fitting an ensemble of 
latent mixture models. The multimodal automated phenotyping (MAP) algorithm 
yields a predicted probability of phenotype for each patient and a threshold for 
classifying participants with phenotype yes/no. The algorithm was validated 
using labeled data for 16 phenotypes from a biorepository and further tested in 
an independent cohort phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) for 2 single 
nucleotide polymorphisms with known associations.
RESULTS: The MAP algorithm achieved higher or similar AUC and F-scores compared 
to the ICD code across all 16 phenotypes. The features assembled via the 
automated approach had comparable accuracy to those assembled via manual 
curation (AUCMAP 0.943, AUCmanual 0.941). The PheWAS results suggest that the 
MAP approach detected previously validated associations with higher power when 
compared to the standard PheWAS method based on ICD codes.
CONCLUSION: The MAP approach increased the accuracy of phenotype definition 
while maintaining scalability, thereby facilitating use in studies requiring 
large-scale phenotyping, such as PheWAS.
