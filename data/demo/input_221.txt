Routine patient data in electronic patient records are only partly structured, 
and an even smaller segment is coded, mainly for administrative purposes. Large 
parts are only available as free text. Transforming this content into a 
structured and semantically explicit form is a prerequisite for querying and 
information extraction. The core of the system architecture presented in this 
paper is based on SAP HANA in-memory database technology using the SAP Connected 
Health platform for data integration as well as for clinical data warehousing. A 
natural language processing pipeline analyses unstructured content and maps it 
to a standardized vocabulary within a well-defined information model. The 
resulting semantically standardized patient profiles are used for a broad range 
of clinical and research application scenarios.
