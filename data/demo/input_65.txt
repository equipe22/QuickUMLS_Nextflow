BACKGROUND: With the improvements to text mining technology and the availability 
of large unstructured Electronic Healthcare Records (EHR) datasets, it is now 
possible to extract structured information from raw text contained within EHR at 
reasonably high accuracy. We describe a text mining system for classifying 
radiologists' reports of CT and MRI brain scans, assigning labels indicating 
occurrence and type of stroke, as well as other observations. Our system, the 
Edinburgh Information Extraction for Radiology reports (EdIE-R) system, which we 
describe here, was developed and tested on a collection of radiology reports.The 
work reported in this paper is based on 1168 radiology reports from the 
Edinburgh Stroke Study (ESS), a hospital-based register of stroke and transient 
ischaemic attack patients. We manually created annotations for this data in 
parallel with developing the rule-based EdIE-R system to identify phenotype 
information related to stroke in radiology reports. This process was iterative 
and domain expert feedback was considered at each iteration to adapt and tune 
the EdIE-R text mining system which identifies entities, negation and relations 
between entities in each report and determines report-level labels (phenotypes).
RESULTS: The inter-annotator agreement (IAA) for all types of annotations is 
high at 96.96 for entities, 96.46 for negation, 95.84 for relations and 94.02 
for labels. The equivalent system scores on the blind test set are equally high 
at 95.49 for entities, 94.41 for negation, 98.27 for relations and 96.39 for 
labels for the first annotator and 96.86, 96.01, 96.53 and 92.61, respectively 
for the second annotator.
CONCLUSION: Automated reading of such EHR data at such high levels of accuracies 
opens up avenues for population health monitoring and audit, and can provide a 
resource for epidemiological studies. We are in the process of validating EdIE-R 
in separate larger cohorts in NHS England and Scotland. The manually annotated 
ESS corpus will be available for research purposes on application.
