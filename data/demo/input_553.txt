Healthcare providers make time-sensitive care decisions based on EHR data. As 
systems of record, the EHR is often not configured to optimally surface timely 
information. For patients awaiting admission, infection control concerns that 
potentially require private rooms can prolong stays in the Emergency Department. 
We aim to determine if an event-based notification platform connected with a 
commercial EHR can help prioritize timely information and improve patient flow 
in the emergency department. We undertook a pre-post analysis for patients being 
admitted from the emergency room who were tested for influenza. We used a 
primary outcome of mean time from negative test result to inpatient transfer. 
The median time decreased by 27%, from 4.1 hours to 3.0 hours. The distribution 
of transfer times pre and post-intervention were significantly different with a 
p-value of <0.001. Our findings support the use of event-based notification 
systems to improve patient flow in the emergency department.
