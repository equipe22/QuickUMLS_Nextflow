Chemical named entity recognition (NER) is an active field of research in 
biomedical natural language processing. To facilitate the development of new and 
superior chemical NER systems, BioCreative released the CHEMDNER corpus, an 
extensive dataset of diverse manually annotated chemical entities. Most of the 
systems trained on the corpus rely on complicated hand-crafted rules or curated 
databases for data preprocessing, feature extraction and output post-processing, 
though modern machine learning algorithms, such as deep neural networks, can 
automatically design the rules with little to none human intervention. Here we 
explored this approach by experimenting with various deep learning architectures 
for targeted tokenisation and named entity recognition. Our final model, based 
on a combination of convolutional and stateful recurrent neural networks with 
attention-like loops and hybrid word- and character-level embeddings, reaches 
near human-level performance on the testing dataset with no manually asserted 
rules. To make our model easily accessible for standalone use and integration in 
third-party software, we've developed a Python package with a minimalistic user 
interface.
