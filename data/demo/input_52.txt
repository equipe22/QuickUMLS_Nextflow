OBJECTIVE: The US Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) collects 
spontaneous reports of adverse events following vaccination. Medical officers 
review the reports and often apply standardized case definitions, such as those 
developed by the Brighton Collaboration. Our objective was to demonstrate a 
multi-level text mining approach for automated text classification of VAERS 
reports that could potentially reduce human workload.
DESIGN: We selected 6034 VAERS reports for H1N1 vaccine that were classified by 
medical officers as potentially positive (N(pos)=237) or negative for 
anaphylaxis. We created a categorized corpus of text files that included the 
class label and the symptom text field of each report. A validation set of 1100 
labeled text files was also used. Text mining techniques were applied to extract 
three feature sets for important keywords, low- and high-level patterns. A 
rule-based classifier processed the high-level feature representation, while 
several machine learning classifiers were trained for the remaining two feature 
representations.
MEASUREMENTS: Classifiers' performance was evaluated by macro-averaging recall, 
precision, and F-measure, and Friedman's test; misclassification error rate 
analysis was also performed.
RESULTS: Rule-based classifier, boosted trees, and weighted support vector 
machines performed well in terms of macro-recall, however at the expense of a 
higher mean misclassification error rate. The rule-based classifier performed 
very well in terms of average sensitivity and specificity (79.05% and 94.80%, 
respectively).
CONCLUSION: Our validated results showed the possibility of developing effective 
medical text classifiers for VAERS reports by combining text mining with 
informative feature selection; this strategy has the potential to reduce 
reviewer workload considerably.
