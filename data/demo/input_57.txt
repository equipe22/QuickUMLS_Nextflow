BACKGROUND: Natural language processing (NLP) of health-related data is still an 
expertise demanding, and resource expensive process. We created a novel, open 
source rapid clinical text mining system called NimbleMiner. NimbleMiner 
combines several machine learning techniques (word embedding models and positive 
only labels learning) to facilitate the process in which a human rapidly 
performs text mining of clinical narratives, while being aided by the machine 
learning components.
OBJECTIVE: This manuscript describes the general system architecture and user 
Interface and presents results of a case study aimed at classifying fall-related 
information (including fall history, fall prevention interventions, and fall 
risk) in homecare visit notes.
METHODS: We extracted a corpus of homecare visit notes (n = 1,149,586) for 
89,459 patients from a large US-based homecare agency. We used a gold standard 
testing dataset of 750 notes annotated by two human reviewers to compare the 
NimbleMiner's ability to classify documents regarding whether they contain 
fall-related information with a previously developed rule-based NLP system.
RESULTS: NimbleMiner outperformed the rule-based system in almost all domains. 
The overall F- score was 85.8% compared to 81% by the rule based-system with the 
best performance for identifying general fall history (F = 89% vs. F = 85.1% 
rule-based), followed by fall risk (F = 87% vs. F = 78.7% rule-based), fall 
prevention interventions (F = 88.1% vs. F = 78.2% rule-based) and fall within 
2 days of the note date (F = 83.1% vs. F = 80.6% rule-based). The rule-based 
system achieved slightly better performance for fall within 2 weeks of the note 
date (F = 81.9% vs. F = 84% rule-based).
DISCUSSION & CONCLUSIONS: NimbleMiner outperformed other systems aimed at fall 
information classification, including our previously developed rule-based 
approach. These promising results indicate that clinical text mining can be 
implemented without the need for large labeled datasets necessary for other 
types of machine learning. This is critical for domains with little NLP 
developments, like nursing or allied health professions.
