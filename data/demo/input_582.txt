BACKGROUND: Timely identification of medication administration errors (MAEs) 
promises great benefits for mitigating medication errors and associated harm. 
Despite previous efforts utilizing computerized methods to monitor medication 
errors, sustaining effective and accurate detection of MAEs remains challenging. 
In this study, we developed a real-time MAE detection system and evaluated its 
performance prior to system integration into institutional workflows.
METHODS: Our prospective observational study included automated MAE detection of 
10 high-risk medications and fluids for patients admitted to the neonatal 
intensive care unit at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center during a 
4-month period. The automated system extracted real-time medication use 
information from the institutional electronic health records and identified MAEs 
using logic-based rules and natural language processing techniques. The MAE 
summary was delivered via a real-time messaging platform to promote reduction of 
patient exposure to potential harm. System performance was validated using a 
physician-generated gold standard of MAE events, and results were compared with 
those of current practice (incident reporting and trigger tools).
RESULTS: Physicians identified 116 MAEs from 10 104 medication administrations 
during the study period. Compared to current practice, the sensitivity with 
automated MAE detection was improved significantly from 4.3% to 85.3% 
(P = .009), with a positive predictive value of 78.0%. Furthermore, the system 
showed potential to reduce patient exposure to harm, from 256 min to 35 min 
(P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: The automated system demonstrated improved capacity for identifying 
MAEs while guarding against alert fatigue. It also showed promise for reducing 
patient exposure to potential harm following MAE events.
