OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper is to describe by a Platform Independent 
Model, the formal specification of an ontology-based service for electronic 
health records interoperability.
METHODS: The GCM is used as a framework for the service's architectural design. 
The formal specification of the service is an extension of the OMG CTS 2 
specification. A review of mapping approaches is also provided.
RESULTS: The paper describes the service' information and computation models, 
including the mapping process workflow. The platform specific implementation 
(Platform Specific Model) is provided as a set of WSDL interfaces. The 
specification includes ontology mapping algorithms and tools needed.
