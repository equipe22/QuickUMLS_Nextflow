Genomics &amp; Informatics (NLM title abbreviation: Genomics Inform) is the 
official journal of the Korea Genome Organization. Text corpus for this journal 
annotated with various levels of linguistic information would be a valuable 
resource as the process of information extraction requires syntactic, semantic, 
and higher levels of natural language processing. In this study, we publish our 
new corpus called GNI Corpus version 1.0, extracted and annotated from full 
texts of Genomics &amp; Informatics, with NLTK (Natural Language ToolKit)-based 
text mining script. The preliminary version of the corpus could be used as a 
training and testing set of a system that serves a variety of functions for 
future biomedical text mining.
