BACKGROUND: We describe a prototype implementation of a platform that could 
underlie a Precision Oncology Rapid Learning system.
RESULTS: We describe the prototype platform, and examine some important issues 
and details. In the Appendix we provide a complete walk-through of the prototype 
platform.
CONCLUSIONS: The design choices made in this implementation rest upon ten 
constitutive hypotheses, which, taken together, define a particular view of how 
a rapid learning medical platform might be defined, organized, and implemented.
