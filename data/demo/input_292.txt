With the development of platforms enabling the integration and use of phenome, 
genome, and exposome data in the context of international research, data 
management challenges are increasing, and scalable solutions for cross border 
and cross domain semantic interoperability need to be developed. Reusing 
routinely collected clinical data, especially, requires computable portable 
phenotype algorithms running across different electronic health record (EHR) 
products and healthcare systems. We propose a framework for describing and 
comparing mediation platforms enabling cross border phenotype identification 
within federated EHRs. This framework was used to describe the experience gained 
during the EHR4CR project and the evaluation of the platform developed for 
accessing semantically equivalent data elements across 11 European participating 
EHR systems from 5 countries. Developers of semantic interoperability platforms 
are beginning to address a core set of requirements in order to reach the goal 
of developing cross border semantic integration of data.
