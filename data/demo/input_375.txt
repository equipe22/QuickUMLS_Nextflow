OBJECTIVE: We address the task of extracting information from free-text 
pathology reports, focusing on staging information encoded by the TNM 
(tumour-node-metastases) and ACPS (Australian clinico-pathological stage) 
systems. Staging information is critical for diagnosing the extent of cancer in 
a patient and for planning individualised treatment. Extracting such information 
into more structured form saves time, improves reporting, and underpins the 
potential for automated decision support.
METHODS AND MATERIAL: We investigate the portability of a text mining model 
constructed from records from one health centre, by applying it directly to the 
extraction task over a set of records from a different health centre, with 
different reporting narrative characteristics. Other than a simple normalisation 
step on features associated with target labels, we apply the models from one 
system directly to the other.
RESULTS: The best F-scores for in-hospital experiments are 81%, 85%, and 94% 
(for staging T, N, and M respectively), while best cross-hospital F-scores reach 
84%, 81%, and 91% for the same respective categories.
CONCLUSIONS: Our performance results compare favourably to the best levels 
reported in the literature, and--most relevant to our aim here--the cross-corpus 
results demonstrate the portability of the models we developed.
