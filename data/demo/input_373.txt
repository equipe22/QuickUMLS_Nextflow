Although text mining shows considerable promise as a tool for supporting the 
curation of biomedical text, there is little concrete evidence as to its 
effectiveness. We report on three experiments measuring the extent to which 
curation can be speeded up with assistance from Natural Language Processing 
(NLP), together with subjective feedback from curators on the usability of a 
curation tool that integrates NLP hypotheses for protein-protein interactions 
(PPIs). In our curation scenario, we found that a maximum speed-up of 1/3 in 
curation time can be expected if NLP output is perfectly accurate. The 
preference of one curator for consistent NLP output and output with high recall 
needs to be confirmed in a larger study with several curators.
