INTRODUCTION: Duplicate case reports in spontaneous adverse event reporting 
systems pose a challenge for medical reviewers to efficiently perform individual 
and aggregate safety analyses. Duplicate cases can bias data mining by 
generating spurious signals of disproportional reporting of product-adverse 
event pairs.
OBJECTIVE: We have developed a probabilistic record linkage algorithm for 
identifying duplicate cases in the US Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System 
(VAERS) and the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System 
(FAERS).
METHODS: In addition to using structured field data, the algorithm incorporates 
the non-structured narrative text of adverse event reports by examining clinical 
and temporal information extracted by the Event-based Text-mining of Health 
Electronic Records system, a natural language processing tool. The final 
component of the algorithm is a novel duplicate confidence value that is 
calculated by a rule-based empirical approach that looks for similarities in a 
number of criteria between two case reports.
RESULTS: For VAERS, the algorithm identified 77% of known duplicate pairs with a 
precision (or positive predictive value) of 95%. For FAERS, it identified 13% of 
known duplicate pairs with a precision of 100%. The textual information did not 
improve the algorithm's automated classification for VAERS or FAERS. The 
empirical duplicate confidence value increased performance on both VAERS and 
FAERS, mainly by reducing the occurrence of false-positives.
CONCLUSIONS: The algorithm was shown to be effective at identifying pre-linked 
duplicate VAERS reports. The narrative text was not shown to be a key component 
in the automated detection evaluation; however, it is essential for supporting 
the semi-automated approach that is likely to be deployed at the Food and Drug 
Administration, where medical reviewers will perform some manual review of the 
most highly ranked reports identified by the algorithm.
