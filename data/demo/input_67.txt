Data is foundational to high-quality artificial intelligence (AI). Given that a 
substantial amount of clinically relevant information is embedded in 
unstructured data, natural language processing (NLP) plays an essential role in 
extracting valuable information that can benefit decision making, administration 
reporting, and research. Here, we share several desiderata pertaining to 
development and usage of NLP systems, derived from two decades of experience 
implementing clinical NLP at the Mayo Clinic, to inform the healthcare AI 
community. Using a framework, we developed as an example implementation, the 
desiderata emphasize the importance of a user-friendly platform, efficient 
collection of domain expert inputs, seamless integration with clinical data, and 
a highly scalable computing infrastructure.
