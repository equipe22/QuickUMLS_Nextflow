BACKGROUND: Medication errors are estimated to cost $42 billion in annual global 
treatment costs. Pharmacy-based Patient Safety Organizations (PSO) are tasked 
with collecting and analyzing incidents, near misses, and unsafe condition 
reports as one way of engaging pharmacies in quality improvement efforts. 
Collectively, these reports are referred to as quality related events (QREs). 
Large-scale analysis of typed narratives from QRE reports across organizations 
has been a missing component of quality improvement programs.
OBJECTIVE: To identify topics within the components of a proposed medication 
safety event framework contained in the free-text narrative of QRE reports.
METHODS: A retrospective, observational analysis of data from a PSOs voluntary 
reporting system, from January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2014. The dataset 
contained structured and unstructured data elements. A structural topic model 
extracted themes from the free-text narrative component of the report. These 
topics were assigned a human label and mapped onto constructs of the medication 
safety event framework.
RESULTS: A total of 531,555 QREs were analyzed from 1660 pharmacies. 90.6% were 
near miss and unsafe condition reports. There were 40 topics generated. There 
were 29 topics identified as QRE types, 3 were identified as contributing 
factors, and 5 were related to signals/alerts that an incident or near miss had 
occurred. One topic each was identified as a recovery step and a quality 
improvement strategy. One topic was not assigned a human label. Examples of 
topics labeled included incorrect tapering directions, needing to double-check 
work, and attention-related contributing factor.
CONCLUSIONS: The free-text narrative provided novel information compared to the 
structured fields of the reports. Topics were mapped onto a proposed medication 
safety event framework to advance knowledge of medication QREs and identify ways 
to improve medication safety in community pharmacy. Future work may focus on 
communicating these topics to the pharmacies to improve medication safety 
efforts.
