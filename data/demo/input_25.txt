Precise phenotype information is needed to understand the effects of genetic and 
epigenetic changes on tumor behavior and responsiveness. Extraction and 
representation of cancer phenotypes is currently mostly performed manually, 
making it difficult to correlate phenotypic data to genomic data. In addition, 
genomic data are being produced at an increasingly faster pace, exacerbating the 
problem. The DeepPhe software enables automated extraction of detailed phenotype 
information from electronic medical records of cancer patients. The system 
implements advanced Natural Language Processing and knowledge engineering 
methods within a flexible modular architecture, and was evaluated using a 
manually annotated dataset of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center breast 
cancer patients. The resulting platform provides critical and missing 
computational methods for computational phenotyping. Working in tandem with 
advanced analysis of high-throughput sequencing, these approaches will further 
accelerate the transition to precision cancer treatment. Cancer Res; 77(21);
