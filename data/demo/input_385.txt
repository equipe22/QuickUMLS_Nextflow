BACKGROUND: Warfarin requires individualized dosing and monitoring in the 
ambulatory setting for protection against thromboembolic disease. Yet in 
multiple settings, patients spend upwards of 30% of time outside the therapeutic 
range, subjecting them to an increased risk of adverse events. At an urban, 
publicly funded clinic, the electronic health record (EHR) would not support 
integration with extant warfarin management software, which led to the creation 
and implementation of an electronic patient registry and a complementary 
team-based work flow to provide real-time health-system-level data for warfarin 
patients.
METHODS: Creation of the registry, which began in August 2014, entailed use of 
an existing platform, which could interface with the outpatient EHR. The 
registry was designed to help ensure regular testing and monitoring of patients 
while enabling identification of patients and subpopulations with suboptimal 
management. The work flow used for the clinic's warfarin patients was also 
redesigned. An assessment indicated that the registry identified 341 (96%) of 
357 patients actively seen in the clinic.
RESULTS: For the cohort of the 357 patients in the registry, the no-show rate 
decreased from 31% (preimplementation, August 2014-December 2014) to 21% 
(postimplementation, January 2015-November 2015). The ratio of visits to 
no-shows increased from 2.3 to 4.0 visits.
CONCLUSION: Design and implementation of an electronic registry in conjunction 
with a complementary work flow established an active tracking system that 
improved treatment monitoring for patients on anticoagulation therapy. Registry 
creation also facilitated assessment of the quality of care and laid the 
groundwork for ongoing evaluation and quality improvement efforts.
