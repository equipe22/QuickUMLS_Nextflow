This paper describes the use of an agile text mining platform (Linguamatics' 
Interactive Information Extraction Platform, I2E) to extract document-level 
cardiac risk factors in patient records as defined in the i2b2/UTHealth 2014 
challenge. The approach uses a data-driven rule-based methodology with the 
addition of a simple supervised classifier. We demonstrate that agile text 
mining allows for rapid optimization of extraction strategies, while 
post-processing can leverage annotation guidelines, corpus statistics and logic 
inferred from the gold standard data. We also show how data imbalance in a 
training set affects performance. Evaluation of this approach on the test data 
gave an F-Score of 91.7%, one percent behind the top performing system.
