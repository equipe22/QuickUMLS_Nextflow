The paper describes a rule-based information extraction (IE) system developed 
for Polish medical texts. We present two applications designed to select data 
from medical documentation in Polish: mammography reports and hospital records 
of diabetic patients. First, we have designed a special ontology that 
subsequently had its concepts translated into two separate models, represented 
as typed feature structure (TFS) hierarchies, complying with the format required 
by the IE platform we adopted. Then, we used dedicated IE grammars to process 
documents and fill in templates provided by the models. In particular, in the 
grammars, we addressed such linguistic issues as: ambiguous keywords, negation, 
coordination or anaphoric expressions. Resolving some of these problems has been 
deferred to a post-processing phase where the extracted information is further 
grouped and structured into more complex templates. To this end, we defined 
special heuristic algorithms on the basis of sample data. The evaluation of the 
implemented procedures shows their usability for clinical data extraction tasks. 
For most of the evaluated templates, precision and recall well above 80% were 
obtained.
