Depending mostly on voluntarily sent spontaneous reports, pharmacovigilance 
studies are hampered by low quantity and quality of patient data. Our objective 
is to improve postmarket safety studies by enabling safety analysts to 
seamlessly access a wide range of EHR sources for collecting deidentified 
medical data sets of selected patient populations and tracing the reported 
incidents back to original EHRs. We have developed an ontological framework 
where EHR sources and target clinical research systems can continue using their 
own local data models, interfaces, and terminology systems, while structural 
interoperability and Semantic Interoperability are handled through rule-based 
reasoning on formal representations of different models and terminology systems 
maintained in the SALUS Semantic Resource Set. SALUS Common Information Model at 
the core of this set acts as the common mediator. We demonstrate the 
capabilities of our framework through one of the SALUS safety analysis tools, 
namely, the Case Series Characterization Tool, which have been deployed on top 
of regional EHR Data Warehouse of the Lombardy Region containing about 1 billion 
records from 16 million patients and validated by several pharmacovigilance 
researchers with real-life cases. The results confirm significant improvements 
in signal detection and evaluation compared to traditional methods with the 
missing background information.
