Paper based medical records are still widespread in Italian hospitals and the 
workflow to manage outpatients' visits is critical. Too many isolated software 
programs coexist in hospital wards and cause confusion and disorganization. A 
computerized medical record that unifies all the data contained in the various 
applications should be of fundamental importance in supporting physician's daily 
activities. Moreover, with the digital clinical record, data can be re-used for 
research purposes. The aim of this project is to create a web application for 
the management of outpatient visits to the Infectious Diseases Unit of the San 
Martino Hospital in Genoa. In order to orchestrate all the software programs 
acting in the visit workflow, a client application was developed to speed up the 
work of the medical staff at the time of the visits, ameliorating the quantity 
and quality of relevant information from a clinical point of view. A further 
extension allows standard data exchange between the developed application and 
the Ligurian HIV Network, which is the main regional research platform.
