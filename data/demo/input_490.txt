MOTIVATION: Negative information about protein-protein interactions--from 
uncertainty about the occurrence of an interaction to knowledge that it did not 
occur--is often of great use to biologists and could lead to important 
discoveries. Yet, to our knowledge, no proposals focusing on extracting such 
information have been proposed in the text mining literature.
RESULTS: In this work, we present an analysis of the types of negative 
information that is reported, and a heuristic-based system using a full 
dependency parser to extract such information. We performed a preliminary 
evaluation study that shows encouraging results of our system. Finally, we have 
obtained an initial corpus of negative protein-protein interactions as basis for 
the construction of larger ones.
AVAILABILITY: The corpus is available by request from the authors.
