MOTIVATION: Recently, several information extraction systems have been developed 
to retrieve relevant information out of biomedical text. However, these methods 
represent individual efforts. In this paper, we show that by combining different 
algorithms and their outcome, the results improve significantly. For this 
reason, CONAN has been created, a system which combines different programs and 
their outcome. Its methods include tagging of gene/protein names, finding 
interaction and mutation data, tagging of biological concepts and linking to 
MeSH and Gene Ontology terms.
RESULTS: In this paper, we will present data that show that combining different 
text-mining algorithms significantly improves the results. Not only is CONAN a 
full-scale approach that will ultimately cover all of PubMed/MEDLINE, we also 
show that this universality has no effect on quality: our system performs as 
well as or better than existing systems.
AVAILABILITY: The LDD corpus presented is available by request to the author. 
The system will be available shortly. For information and updates on CONAN
