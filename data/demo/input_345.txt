Comparative effectiveness research (CER) studies involving multiple institutions 
with diverse electronic health records (EHRs) depend on high quality data. To 
ensure uniformity of data derived from different EHR systems and 
implementations, the CER Hub informatics platform developed a quality assurance 
(QA) process using tools and data formats available through the CER Hub. The QA 
process, implemented here in a study of smoking cessation services in primary 
care, used the 'emrAdapter' tool programmed with a set of quality checks to 
query large samples of primary care encounter records extracted in accord with 
the CER Hub common data framework. The tool, deployed to each study site, 
generated error reports indicating data problems to be fixed locally and 
aggregate data sharable with the central site for quality review. Across the CER 
Hub network of six health systems, data completeness and correctness issues were 
prevalent in the first iteration and were considerably improved after three 
iterations of the QA process. A common issue encountered was incomplete mapping 
of local EHR data values to those defined by the common data framework. A highly 
automated and distributed QA process helped to ensure the correctness and 
completeness of patient care data extracted from EHRs for a multi-institution 
CER study in smoking cessation.
