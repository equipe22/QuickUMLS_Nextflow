We have developed a simple text mining algorithm that allows us to identify 
surface area and pore volumes of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) using 
manuscript html files as inputs. The algorithm searches for common units (e.g., 
m2/g, cm3/g) associated with these two quantities to facilitate the search. From 
the sample set data of over 200 MOFs, the algorithm managed to identify 90% and 
88.8% of the correct surface area and pore volume values. Further application to 
a test set of randomly chosen MOF html files yielded 73.2% and 85.1% accuracies 
for the two respective quantities. Most of the errors stem from unorthodox 
sentence structures that made it difficult to identify the correct data as well 
as bolded notations of MOFs (e.g., 1a) that made it difficult identify its real 
name. These types of tools will become useful when it comes to discovering 
structure-property relationships among MOFs as well as collecting a large set of 
data for references.
