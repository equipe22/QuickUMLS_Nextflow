In this paper, we present the framework of a Gene Regulatory Networks System: 
GRNS. The goals of GRNS include automatically mining biomedical literature to 
extract gene regulatory information (strain number, genotype, gene regulatory 
relation, and phenotype), automatically constructing gene regulatory networks 
based on extracted information and integrating biomedical knowledge into the 
regulatory networks.
