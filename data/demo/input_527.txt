E-Health systems are experiencing an impulse in these last years, when many 
medical agencies began to include digital solutions into their platforms. 
Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are one of the most important improvements, 
being in its most part a patient-oriented tool. To achieve a completely 
operational EHR platform, security and privacy problems have to be resolved, due 
to the importance of the data included within these records. But given all the 
different methods to address security and privacy, they still remain in most 
cases as an open issue. This paper studies existing and proposed solutions 
included in different scenarios, in order to offer an overview of the current 
state in EHR systems. Bibliographic material has been obtained mainly from 
MEDLINE and SCOPUS sources, and over 30 publications have been analyzed. Many 
EHR platforms are being developed, but most of them present weaknesses when they 
are opened to the public. These architectures gain significance when they cover 
all the requisites related to security and privacy.
