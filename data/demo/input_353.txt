Named entity recognition is an extremely important and fundamental task of 
biomedical text mining. Biomedical named entities include mentions of proteins, 
genes, DNA, RNA, etc which often have complex structures, but it is challenging 
to identify and classify such entities. Machine learning methods like CRF, MEMM 
and SVM have been widely used for learning to recognize such entities from an 
annotated corpus. The identification of appropriate feature templates and the 
selection of the important feature values play a very important role in the 
success of these methods. In this paper, we provide a study on word clustering 
and selection based feature reduction approaches for named entity recognition 
using a maximum entropy classifier. The identification and selection of features 
are largely done automatically without using domain knowledge. The performance 
of the system is found to be superior to existing systems which do not use 
domain knowledge.
