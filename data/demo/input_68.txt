Biomedical text mining promises to assist biologists in quickly navigating the 
combined knowledge in their domain. This would allow improved understanding of 
the complex interactions within biological systems and faster hypothesis 
generation. New biomedical research articles are published daily and text mining 
tools are only as good as the corpus from which they work. Many text mining 
tools are underused because their results are static and do not reflect the 
constantly expanding knowledge in the field. In order for biomedical text mining 
to become an indispensable tool used by researchers, this problem must be 
addressed. To this end, we present PubRunner, a framework for regularly running 
text mining tools on the latest publications. PubRunner is lightweight, simple 
to use, and can be integrated with an existing text mining tool. The workflow 
involves downloading the latest abstracts from PubMed, executing a user-defined 
tool, pushing the resulting data to a public FTP or Zenodo dataset, and 
publicizing the location of these results on the public PubRunner website. We 
illustrate the use of this tool by re-running the commonly used word2vec tool on 
the latest PubMed abstracts to generate up-to-date word vector representations 
for the biomedical domain. This shows a proof of concept that we hope will 
encourage text mining developers to build tools that truly will aid biologists 
in exploring the latest publications.
