BACKGROUND: The majority of individuals with Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) do not 
receive any formal substance use treatment. Due to limited engagement and access 
to traditional treatment, there is increasing evidence that patients with OUDs 
turn to online social platforms to access peer support and obtain health-related 
information about addiction and recovery. Interacting with peers before and 
during recovery is a key component of many evidence-based addiction recovery 
programs, and may improve self-efficacy and treatment engagement as well as 
reduce relapse. Commonly-used online social platforms are limited in utility and 
scalability as an adjunct to addiction treatment; lack effective content 
moderation (e.g., misinformed advice, maliciousness or "trolling"); and lack 
common security and ethical safeguards inherent to clinical care.
METHODS: This present study will develop a novel, artificial-intelligence (AI) 
enabled, mobile treatment delivery method that fulfills the need for a robust, 
secure, technology-based peer support platform to support patients with OUD. 
Forty adults receiving outpatient buprenorphine treatment for OUD will be asked 
to pilot a smartphone-based mobile peer support application, the "Marigold App", 
for a duration of six weeks. The program will use (1) a prospective cohort study 
to obtain text message content and feasibility metrics, and (2) qualitative 
interviews to evaluate usability and acceptability of the mobile platform.
ANTICIPATED FINDINGS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS: The Marigold mobile platform will 
allow patients to access a tailored chat support group 24/7 as a complement to 
different forms of clinical OUD treatment. Marigold can keep groups safe and 
constructive by augmenting chats with AI tools capable of understanding the 
emotional sentiment in messages, automatically "flagging" critical or clinically 
relevant content. This project will demonstrate the robustness of these AI tools 
by adapting them to catch OUD-specific "flags" in peer messages while also 
examining the adoptability of the platform itself within OUD patients.
