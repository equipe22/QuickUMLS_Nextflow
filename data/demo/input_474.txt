Feature selection is of paramount importance for text-mining classifiers with 
high-dimensional features. The Turku Event Extraction System (TEES) is the best 
performing tool in the GENIA BioNLP 2009/2011 shared tasks, which relies heavily 
on high-dimensional features. This paper describes research which, based on an 
implementation of an accumulated effect evaluation (AEE) algorithm applying the 
greedy search strategy, analyses the contribution of every single feature class 
in TEES with a view to identify important features and modify the feature set 
accordingly. With an updated feature set, a new system is acquired with enhanced 
performance which achieves an increased F-score of 53.27% up from 51.21% for 
Task 1 under strict evaluation criteria and 57.24% according to the approximate 
span and recursive criterion.
