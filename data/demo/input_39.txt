BACKGROUND: In order to investigate the mechanisms of cardiovascular disease in 
HIV infected and uninfected patients, an analysis of echocardiogram reports is 
required for a large longitudinal multi-center study.
IMPLEMENTATION: A natural language processing system using a dictionary lookup, 
rules, and patterns was developed to extract heart function measurements that 
are typically recorded in echocardiogram reports as measurement-value pairs. 
Curated semantic bootstrapping was used to create a custom dictionary that 
extends existing terminologies based on terms that actually appear in the 
medical record. A novel disambiguation method based on semantic constraints was 
created to identify and discard erroneous alternative definitions of the 
measurement terms. The system was built utilizing a scalable framework, making 
it available for processing large datasets.
RESULTS: The system was developed for and validated on notes from three sources: 
general clinic notes, echocardiogram reports, and radiology reports. The system 
achieved F-scores of 0.872, 0.844, and 0.877 with precision of 0.936, 0.982, and 
0.969 for each dataset respectively averaged across all extracted values. Left 
ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is the most frequently extracted 
measurement. The precision of extraction of the LVEF measure ranged from 0.968 
to 1.0 across different document types.
CONCLUSIONS: This system illustrates the feasibility and effectiveness of a 
large-scale information extraction on clinical data. New clinical questions can 
be addressed in the domain of heart failure using retrospective clinical data 
analysis because key heart function measurements can be successfully extracted 
using natural language processing.
