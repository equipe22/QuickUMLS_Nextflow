The numbers of articles and journals that are published are increasing at a 
considerable rate, and the published information is growing continuously and 
fast. Because of this, researches to acquire knowledge automatically have been 
carried out in the areas of information retrieval, information extraction and 
text mining. Information retrieval approaches are good for specific topics that 
the number of related articles is small. But, if the number is bigger, searching 
skill and knowledge acquisition ability are useless. Though many efforts have 
been made to extract information from literature, many approaches have 
concentrated on specific entities, such as proteins, genes and their 
interactions, and much information is still remained in unstructured text. So, 
we have developed a system that discovers relations between various categories 
of biomedical entities. Our system collects abstracts from PubMed by queries 
representing a topic and visualizes relationship from the collection by 
automatic information extraction.
