Clinical data captured in hospital information systems may be unusable in their 
original format due to missing information or knowledge. The use of external 
resources (e.g. domain ontology) could be a way of dealing with this lack of 
knowledge. Our study thus aimed to develop a framework allowing a user to 
perform medical queries in the context of infectious diseases. By creating an 
interaction between a knowledge source and clinical data, using semantic and 
semantic web tools and methods, the users are able to perform queries on a 
database to obtain results about antibiotic resistance. This work has been 
performed in the context of the DebugIT European project that aims to control 
and monitor the antibioresistance growth via a semantic interoperability 
platform. The results obtained by the use of different semantic web tools were 
quantitatively evaluated by comparison of the number of results and the query 
execution time. We have compared our approach with classic business intelligence 
approaches in terms of usability and functionality.
