PURPOSE: To apply text mining (TM) technology on electronic medical records 
(EMRs) of patients with breast cancer (BC) to retrieve the occurrence of a 
pregnancy after BC diagnosis and compare its performance to manual curation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The training cohort (Cohort A) comprised 344 patients 
with BC age ≤ 40 years old treated at Institut Curie between 2005 and 2007. 
Manual curation consisted in manually reviewing each EMR to retrieve 
pregnancies. TM consisted of first applying a keyword filter ("accouch*" or 
"enceinte," French terms for "deliver*" and "pregnant," respectively) to select 
a subset of EMRs, and, second, checking manually EMRs to confirm the pregnancy. 
Then, we applied our TM algorithm on an independent cohort of patients with BC 
treated between 2008 and 2012 (Cohort B).
RESULTS: In Cohort A, 36 pregnancies were identified among 344 patients (10.5%; 
2,829 person-years of EMR). Thirty were identified by manual review versus 35 by 
TM. TM resulted in a lower percentage of manual checking (26.7% v 100%, 
respectively) and substantial time gains (time to identify a pregnancy: 13 
minutes for TM v 244 minutes for manual curation, respectively). Presence of any 
of the two TM filters showed excellent sensitivity (97%) and negative predictive 
value (100%). In Cohort B, 67 pregnancies were identified among 1,226 patients 
(5.5%; 7,349 person-years of EMR). Similarly, for Cohort B, TM spared 904 
(73.7%) EMRs from manual review and quickly generated a cohort of 67 pregnancies 
after BC. Incidence rate of pregnancy after BC was 0.01 pregnancy per 
person-year of EMR in both cohorts.
CONCLUSION: TM is highly efficient to quickly identify rare events and is a 
promising tool to improve rapidity, efficiency, and costs of medical research.
