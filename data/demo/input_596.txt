BACKGROUND: Understanding the potential impact of cannabis use on cardiovascular 
health is increasingly important as cannabis use rises in the U.S. Objectives: 
This study evaluated the associations between regular cannabis use, with and 
without tobacco co-use, and cardiovascular outcomes.
METHODS: Analysis of a limited dataset obtained through IBM Watson Health 
Explorys, a platform integrating electronic health record data. Matched controls 
using Mahalanobis distance within propensity score calipers were defined for: 1) 
cannabis-using patients (n = 8,944; 43% female); and subgroups of cannabis-using 
patients: 2) with an encounter diagnosis for tobacco use disorder (TUD; n 
= 4,682); and 3) without a TUD diagnosis (non-TUD; n = 4,262). Patients had ≥1 
blood pressure measurement and blood chemistry lab result in the MetroHealth 
System (Cleveland, Ohio). Cannabis-using patients had an encounter diagnosis of 
cannabis abuse/dependence and/or ≥2 cannabis-positive urine drug screens. 
Control patients, with no cannabis-use-documentation, were matched to the 
cannabis-using patients on demographics, residential zip code median income, 
body mass index, and, for the total sample, TUD-status. Outcomes were encounter 
diagnosis (yes/no) of cerebrovascular accident (CVA), heart arrhythmia, 
myocardial infarction, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: TUD-patients had the greatest prevalence of cardiovascular disease, 
regardless of cannabis-use indication. In the total sample and non-TUD subgroup, 
regular cannabis use was significantly associated with greater risk for CVA, 
arrhythmia, SAH, and mortality. In the TUD subgroup, regular cannabis use was 
significantly associated with greater risk for arrhythmia and SAH.
CONCLUSIONS: Cannabis use is associated with significantly greater risk of 
adverse cardiovascular diagnoses and overall death, particularly in non-tobacco 
users.
