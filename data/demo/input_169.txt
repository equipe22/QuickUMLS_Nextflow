Conversational agents are being used to help in the screening, assessment, 
diagnosis, and treatment of common mental health disorders. In this paper, we 
propose a bootstrapping approach for the development of a digital mental health 
conversational agent (i.e., chatbot). We start from a basic rule-based expert 
system and iteratively move towards a more sophisticated platform composed of 
specialized chatbots each aiming to assess and pre-diagnose a specific mental 
health disorder using machine learning and natural language processing 
techniques. During each iteration, user feedback from psychiatrists and patients 
are incorporated into the iterative design process. A survival of the fittest 
approach is also used to assess the continuation or removal of a specialized 
mental health chatbot in each generational design. We anticipate that our unique 
and novel approach can be used for the development of conversational mental 
health agents with the ultimate goal of designing a smart chatbot that delivers 
evidence-based care and contributes to scaling up services while decreasing the 
pressure on mental health care providers.
