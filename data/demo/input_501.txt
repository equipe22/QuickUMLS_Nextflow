An electronic health record (EHR) can assist the delivery of high-quality 
patient care, in part by providing the capability for a broad range of clinical 
decision support, including contextual references (e.g., Infobuttons), alerts 
and reminders, order sets, and dashboards. All of these decision support tools 
are based on clinical knowledge; unfortunately, the mechanisms for managing 
rules, order sets, Infobuttons, and dashboards are often unrelated, making it 
difficult to coordinate the application of clinical knowledge to various 
components of the clinical workflow. Additional complexity is encountered when 
updating enterprise-wide knowledge bases and delivering the content through 
multiple modalities to different consumers. We present the experience of Mayo 
Clinic as a case study to examine the requirements and implementation challenges 
related to knowledge management across a large, multi-site medical center. The 
lessons learned through the development of our knowledge management and delivery 
platform will help inform the future development of interoperable knowledge 
resources.
