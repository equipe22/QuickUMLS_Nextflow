The prototype version of the full-text corpus of Genomics & Informatics has 
recently been archived in a GitHub repository. The full-text publications of 
volumes 10 through 17 are also directly downloadable from PubMed Central (PMC) 
as XML files. During the Biomedical Linked Annotation Hackathon 6 (BLAH6), we 
experimented with converting, annotating, and updating 301 PMC full-text 
articles of Genomics & Informatics using PubAnnotation, a system that provides a 
convenient way to add PMC publications based on PMCID. Thus, this review aims to 
provide a tutorial overview of practicing the iterative task of named entity 
recognition with the PubAnnotation/PubDictionaries/TextAE ecosystem. We also 
describe developing a conversion tool between the Genia tagger output and the 
JSON format of PubAnnotation during the hackathon.
