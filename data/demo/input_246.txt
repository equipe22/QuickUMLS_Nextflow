The vast amount of clinical data in electronic health records constitutes a 
great potential for secondary use. However, most of this content consists of 
unstructured or semi-structured texts, which is difficult to process. Several 
challenges are still pending: medical language idiosyncrasies in different 
natural languages, and the large variety of medical terminology systems. In this 
paper we present SEMCARE, a European initiative designed to minimize these 
problems by providing a multi-lingual platform (English, German, and Dutch) that 
allows users to express complex queries and obtain relevant search results from 
clinical texts. SEMCARE is based on a selection of adapted biomedical 
terminologies, together with Apache UIMA and Apache Solr as open source 
state-of-the-art natural language pipeline and indexing technologies. SEMCARE 
has been deployed and is currently being tested at three medical institutions in 
the UK, Austria, and the Netherlands, showing promising results in a cardiology 
use case.
