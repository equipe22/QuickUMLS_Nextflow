The difficult task of detecting adverse drug events (ADEs) and the tedious 
process of building manual reports of ADE occurrences out of patient profiles 
result in a majority of adverse reactions not being reported to health 
regulatory authorities. The SALUS individual case safety report (ICSR) reporting 
tool, a component currently developed within the SALUS project, aims to support 
semi-automatic reporting of ADEs to regulatory authorities. In this paper, we 
present an initial design and current state of of our ICSR reporting tool that 
features: (i) automatic pre-population of reporting forms through extraction of 
the patient data contained in an Electronic Health Record (EHR); (ii) generation 
and electronic submission of the completed ICSRs by the physician to regulatory 
authorities; and (iii) integration of the reporting process into the physician's 
work-flow to limit the disturbance. The objective is to increase the rates of 
ADE reporting and the quality of the reported data. The SALUS interoperability 
platform supports patient data extraction independently of the EHR data model in 
use and allows generation of reports using the format expected by regulatory 
authorities.
