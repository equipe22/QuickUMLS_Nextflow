Radiological reporting generates a large amount of free-text clinical 
narratives, a potentially valuable source of information for improving clinical 
care and supporting research. The use of automatic techniques to analyze such 
reports is necessary to make their content effectively available to radiologists 
in an aggregated form. In this paper we focus on the classification of chest 
computed tomography reports according to a classification schema proposed for 
this task by radiologists of the Italian hospital ASST Spedali Civili di 
Brescia. The proposed system is built exploiting a training data set containing 
reports annotated by radiologists. Each report is classified according to the 
schema developed by radiologists and textual evidences are marked in the report. 
The annotations are then used to train different machine learning based 
classifiers. We present in this paper a method based on a cascade of classifiers 
which make use of a set of syntactic and semantic features. The resulting system 
is a novel hierarchical classification system for the given task, that we have 
experimentally evaluated.
