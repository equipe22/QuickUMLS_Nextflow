Natural language is ubiquitous in the workflow of medical imaging. Radiologists 
create and consume free text in their daily work, some of which can be amenable 
to enhancements through automatic processing. Recent advancements in deep 
learning and "artificial intelligence" have had a significant positive impact on 
natural language processing (NLP). This article discusses the history of how 
researchers have extracted data and encoded natural language information for 
analytical processing, starting from NLP's humble origins in hand-curated, 
linguistic rules. The evolution of medical NLP including vectorization, word 
embedding, classification, as well as its use in automated speech recognition, 
are also explored. Finally, the article will discuss the role of machine 
learning and neural networks in the context of significant, if incremental, 
improvements in NLP.
