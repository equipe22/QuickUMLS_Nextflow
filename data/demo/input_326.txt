BACKGROUND: The amount of medical and clinical-related information on the Web is 
increasing. Among the different types of information available, social 
media-based data obtained directly from people are particularly valuable and are 
attracting significant attention. To encourage medical natural language 
processing (NLP) research exploiting social media data, the 13th NII Testbeds 
and Community for Information access Research (NTCIR-13) Medical natural 
language processing for Web document (MedWeb) provides pseudo-Twitter messages 
in a cross-language and multi-label corpus, covering 3 languages (Japanese, 
English, and Chinese) and annotated with 8 symptom labels (such as cold, fever, 
and flu). Then, participants classify each tweet into 1 of the 2 categories: 
those containing a patient's symptom and those that do not.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to present the results of groups participating in a 
Japanese subtask, English subtask, and Chinese subtask along with discussions, 
to clarify the issues that need to be resolved in the field of medical NLP.
METHODS: In summary, 8 groups (19 systems) participated in the Japanese subtask, 
4 groups (12 systems) participated in the English subtask, and 2 groups (6 
systems) participated in the Chinese subtask. In total, 2 baseline systems were 
constructed for each subtask. The performance of the participant and baseline 
systems was assessed using the exact match accuracy, F-measure based on 
precision and recall, and Hamming loss.
RESULTS: The best system achieved exactly 0.880 match accuracy, 0.920 F-measure, 
and 0.019 Hamming loss. The averages of match accuracy, F-measure, and Hamming 
loss for the Japanese subtask were 0.720, 0.820, and 0.051; those for the 
English subtask were 0.770, 0.850, and 0.037; and those for the Chinese subtask 
were 0.810, 0.880, and 0.032, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: This paper presented and discussed the performance of systems 
participating in the NTCIR-13 MedWeb task. As the MedWeb task settings can be 
formalized as the factualization of text, the achievement of this task could be 
directly applied to practical clinical applications.
