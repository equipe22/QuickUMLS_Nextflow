The Multi-source Integrated Platform for Answering Clinical Questions (MiPACQ) 
is a QA pipeline that integrates a variety of information retrieval and natural 
language processing systems into an extensible question answering system. We 
present the system's architecture and an evaluation of MiPACQ on a 
human-annotated evaluation dataset based on the Medpedia health and medical 
encyclopedia. Compared with our baseline information retrieval system, the 
MiPACQ rule-based system demonstrates 84% improvement in Precision at One and 
the MiPACQ machine-learning-based system demonstrates 134% improvement. Other 
performance metrics including mean reciprocal rank and area under the 
precision/recall curves also showed significant improvement, validating the 
effectiveness of the MiPACQ design and implementation.
