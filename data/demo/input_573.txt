INTRODUCTION: Data based on electronic health records (EHRs) are rich with 
individual-level longitudinal measurement information and are becoming an 
increasingly common data source for clinical risk prediction worldwide. However, 
few EHR-based cohort studies are available in China. Harnessing EHRs for 
research requires a full understanding of data linkages, management, and data 
quality in large data sets, which presents unique analytical opportunities and 
challenges. The purpose of this study is to provide a framework to establish a 
uniquely integrated EHR database in China for scientific research.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The CHinese Electronic health Records Research in Yinzhou 
(CHERRY) Study will extract individual participant data within the regional 
health information system of an eastern coastal area of China to establish a 
longitudinal population-based ambispective cohort study for cardiovascular care 
and outcomes research. A total of 1 053 565 Chinese adults aged over 18 years 
were registered in the health information system in 2009, and there were 23 394 
deaths from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2015. The study will include 
information from multiple epidemiological surveys; EHRs for chronic disease 
management; and health administrative, clinical, laboratory, drug and electronic 
medical record (EMR) databases. Follow-up of fatal and non-fatal clinical events 
is achieved through records linkage to the regional system of disease 
surveillance, chronic disease management and EMRs (based on diagnostic codes 
from the International Classification of Diseases, tenth revision). The CHERRY 
Study will provide a unique platform and serve as a valuable big data resource 
for cardiovascular risk prediction and population management, for primary and 
secondary prevention of cardiovascular events in China.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The CHERRY Study was approved by the Peking University 
Institutional Review Board (IRB00001052-16011) in April 2016. Results of the 
study will be disseminated through published journal articles, conferences and 
seminar presentations, and on the study website (http://www.cherry-study.org).
