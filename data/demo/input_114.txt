Patients' narratives about traumatic experiences and symptoms are useful in 
clinical screening and diagnostic procedures. In this study, we presented an 
automated assessment system to screen patients for posttraumatic stress disorder 
via a natural language processing and text-mining approach. Four 
machine-learning algorithms-including decision tree, naive Bayes, support vector 
machine, and an alternative classification approach called the product score 
model-were used in combination with n-gram representation models to identify 
patterns between verbal features in self-narratives and psychiatric diagnoses. 
With our sample, the product score model with unigrams attained the highest 
prediction accuracy when compared with practitioners' diagnoses. The addition of 
multigrams contributed most to balancing the metrics of sensitivity and 
specificity. This article also demonstrates that text mining is a promising 
approach for analyzing patients' self-expression behavior, thus helping 
clinicians identify potential patients from an early stage.
