BACKGROUND: A wide gulf remains between knowledge and clinical practice. 
Clinical decision support has been demonstrated to be an effective knowledge 
tool that healthcare organizations can employ to deliver the "right knowledge to 
the right people in the right form at the right time". How to adopt various 
clinical decision support (CDS) systems efficiently to facilitate evidence-based 
practice is one challenge faced by knowledge translation research.
METHOD: A computer-aided knowledge translation method that mobilizes 
evidence-based decision supports is proposed. The foundation of the method is a 
knowledge representation model that is able to cover, coordinate and synergize 
various types of medical knowledge to achieve centralized and effective 
knowledge management. Next, web-based knowledge-authoring and natural language 
processing based knowledge acquisition tools are designed to accelerate the 
transformation of the latest clinical evidence into computerized knowledge 
content. Finally, a batch of fundamental services, such as data acquisition and 
inference engine, are designed to actuate the acquired knowledge content. These 
services can be used as building blocks for various evidence-based decision 
support applications.
RESULTS: Based on the above method, a computer-aided knowledge translation 
platform was constructed as a CDS infrastructure. Based on this platform, 
typical CDS applications were developed. A case study of drug use check 
demonstrates that the CDS intervention delivered by the platform has produced 
observable behavior changes (89.7% of alerted medical orders were revised by 
physicians).
DISCUSSION: Computer-aided knowledge translation via a CDS infrastructure can be 
effective in facilitating knowledge translation in clinical settings.
