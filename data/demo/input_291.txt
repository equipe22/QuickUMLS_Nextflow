This paper describes an approach to build a Data Definition Ontology (DDO) in 
the context of full domain ontology integration with datasets in order to share 
and query clinical heterogeneous data repositories. We have adapted an existing 
semantic web tool (D2RQ) to implement a process that automatically generates the 
DDO from a database information model, thanks to reverse engineering and schema 
mapping approaches. This study has been performed in the context of the DebugIT 
European project (Detecting and Eliminating Bacteria UsinG Information 
Technology) that aims to control and monitor the bacterial growth via a semantic 
interoperability platform (IP). The evaluation of the process is based, first, 
on the accuracy of the produced DDO for different samples of database storage 
and second, by checking the congruency between the DDO and the D2RQ database 
mapping file.
