BACKGROUND: In an effort to return actionable results from variant data to 
electronic health records (EHRs), participants in the Electronic Medical Records 
and Genomics (eMERGE) Network are being sequenced with the targeted 
Pharmacogenomics Research Network sequence platform (PGRNseq). This 
cost-effective, highly-scalable, and highly-accurate platform was created to 
explore rare variation in 84 key pharmacogenetic genes with strong drug 
phenotype associations.
METHODS: To return Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) results to 
our participants at the Group Health Cooperative, we sequenced the DNA of 900 
participants (61 % female) with non-CLIA biobanked samples. We then selected 450 
of those to be re-consented, to redraw blood, and ultimately to validate CLIA 
variants in anticipation of returning the results to the participant and EHR. 
These 450 were selected using an algorithm we designed to harness data from 
self-reported race, diagnosis and procedure codes, medical notes, laboratory 
results, and variant-level bioinformatics to ensure selection of an informative 
sample. We annotated the multi-sample variant call format by a combination of 
SeattleSeq and SnpEff tools, with additional custom variables including evidence 
from ClinVar, OMIM, HGMD, and prior clinical associations.
RESULTS: We focused our analyses on 27 actionable genes, largely driven by the 
Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium. We derived a ranking system 
based on the total number of coding variants per participant (75.2±14.7), and 
the number of coding variants with high or moderate impact (11.5±3.9). Notably, 
we identified 11 stop-gained (1 %) and 519 missense (20 %) variants out of a 
total of 1785 in these 27 genes. Finally, we prioritized variants to be returned 
to the EHR with prior clinical evidence of pathogenicity or annotated as 
stop-gain for the following genes: CACNA1S and RYR1 (malignant hyperthermia); 
SCN5A, KCNH2, and RYR2 (arrhythmia); and LDLR (high cholesterol).
CONCLUSIONS: The incorporation of genetics into the EHR for clinical decision 
support is a complex undertaking for many reasons including lack of prior 
consent for return of results, lack of biospecimens collected in a CLIA 
environment, and EHR integration. Our study design accounts for these hurdles 
and is an example of a pilot system that can be utilized before expanding to an 
entire health system.
