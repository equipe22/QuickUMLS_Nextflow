Patients with chronic diseases undergo numerous in- and outpatient treatment 
periods, and therefore many documents accumulate in their electronic records. We 
report on an on-going project focussing on the semantic enrichment of medical 
texts, in order to support recall-oriented navigation across a patient's 
complete documentation. A document pool of 1,696 de-identified discharge 
summaries was used for prototyping. A natural language processing toolset for 
document annotation (based on the text-mining framework UIMA) and indexing 
(Solr) was used to support a browser-based platform for document import, search 
and navigation. The integrated search engine combines free text and 
concept-based querying, supported by dynamically generated facets (diagnoses, 
procedures, medications, lab values, and body parts). The prototype demonstrates 
the feasibility of semantic document enrichment within document collections of a 
single patient. Originally conceived as an add-on for the clinical workplace, 
this technology could also be adapted to support personalised health record 
platforms, as well as cross-patient search for cohort building and other 
secondary use scenarios.
