MOTIVATION: Research on roles of gene products in cells is accumulating and 
changing rapidly, but most of the results are still reported in text form and 
are not directly accessible by computers. To expedite the progress of functional 
bioinformatics, it is, therefore, important to efficiently process large amounts 
of biomedical literature and transform the knowledge extracted into a structured 
format usable by biologists and medical researchers. Our aim was to develop an 
intelligent text-mining system that will extract from biomedical documents 
knowledge about the functions of gene products and thus facilitate computing 
with function.
RESULTS: We have developed an ontology-based text-mining system to efficiently 
extract from biomedical literature knowledge about the functions of gene 
products. We also propose methods of sentence alignment and sentence 
classification to discover the functions of gene products discussed in digital 
texts.
