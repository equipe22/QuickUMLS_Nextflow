This paper presents the design of smart data collection system to deal with the 
drawbacks like EHR data second hand input which is time-consuming and EHR's poor 
usability. The system comprises security certification, information management 
and data transmission modules. Through WLAN, EHR data can transmit between smart 
terminals and server. Also it provides a real-time communication platform for
