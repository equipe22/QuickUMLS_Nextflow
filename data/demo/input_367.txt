FigSearch is a prototype text-mining and classification system for figures from 
any corpus of full-text biological papers. The system allows users to search for 
figures that contain genes of interest and illustrate protein interactions. The 
retrieved figures are ranked by a score representing the likelihood to be of a 
certain type, in this case, schematic illustrations of protein interactions and 
signaling events. The system contains a Web interface for search, a module for 
classification of figures based on vector representations of figure legends and 
a module for indexing gene names. In a preliminary validation, the FigSearch 
system showed satisfactory performance according to domain experts in providing 
the most relevant graphical representations. This strategy may be easily 
extended to other figure types. Moreover, as more full-text data become 
available, such a system will find increased usefulness in identifying and 
presenting compressed biological knowledge.
AVAILABILITY: A searchable Web interface, FigSearch, is accessible via 
http://pubgeneserver.uio.no/figsearch/ for all figures from the available 
corpus.
