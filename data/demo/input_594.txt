BACKGROUND: Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) quantify, from patients' 
perspectives, their symptoms, function, and quality of life. Our aim was to 
determine the feasibility of integrating PRO capture into routine clinical 
practice at a large heart failure (HF) clinic.
METHODS: We examined the practicality of PRO completion at the time of clinic 
visit, the time required to complete the selected instruments, the completion 
rate, and the feasibility of immediate PRO scoring and integration of the 
results into the electronic health record (EHR). We deployed a computer program 
to capture PROs (Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire, Patient-Reported 
Outcomes Measurement Information System) on a portable computer platform at the 
time of a clinic visit. An automated algorithm identified patients scheduled for 
appointments at the HF clinic at registration, provided a portable tablet 
computer with which to complete the appropriate PRO instruments and then scored 
and immediately integrated the results in the patient's EHR.
RESULTS: In a 12-month period, 862 unique patients completed 1,320 PRO 
assessments. The mean age of this cohort was 60.1 ± 16.3 years and 66% were 
male. The average time for PRO assessment was 6.7 minutes and the completion 
rate among eligible patients was 58%, with 91% of started assessments completed 
in full.
CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary data support the feasibility of serial PRO 
assessment with real-time integration into the EHR in a large outpatient 
population of patients with HF. We identified critical steps that should enhance 
adoption of this approach by clinicians and render PRO results meaningful and 
actionable in routine clinical care.
