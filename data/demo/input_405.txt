OBJECTIVE: For many literature review tasks, including systematic review (SR) 
and other aspects of evidence-based medicine, it is important to know whether an 
article describes a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Current manual annotation 
is not complete or flexible enough for the SR process. In this work, highly 
accurate machine learning predictive models were built that include confidence 
predictions of whether an article is an RCT.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The LibSVM classifier was used with forward selection of 
potential feature sets on a large human-related subset of MEDLINE to create a 
classification model requiring only the citation, abstract, and MeSH terms for 
each article.
RESULTS: The model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic 
curve of 0.973 and mean squared error of 0.013 on the held out year 2011 data. 
Accurate confidence estimates were confirmed on a manually reviewed set of test 
articles. A second model not requiring MeSH terms was also created, and performs 
almost as well.
DISCUSSION: Both models accurately rank and predict article RCT confidence. 
Using the model and the manually reviewed samples, it is estimated that about 
8000 (3%) additional RCTs can be identified in MEDLINE, and that 5% of articles 
tagged as RCTs in Medline may not be identified.
CONCLUSION: Retagging human-related studies with a continuously valued RCT 
confidence is potentially more useful for article ranking and review than a 
simple yes/no prediction. The automated RCT tagging tool should offer 
significant savings of time and effort during the process of writing SRs, and is 
a key component of a multistep text mining pipeline that we are building to 
streamline SR workflow. In addition, the model may be useful for identifying 
errors in MEDLINE publication types. The RCT confidence predictions described 
here have been made available to users as a web service with a user query form
