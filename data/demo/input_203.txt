In this paper, we propose a novel neural network architecture for clinical text 
mining. We formulate this hybrid neural network model (HNN), composed of 
recurrent neural network and deep residual network, to jointly predict the 
presence and period assertion values associated with medical events in clinical 
texts. We evaluate the effectiveness of our model on a corpus of 
expert-annotated longitudinal Electronic Health Records (EHR) notes from Cancer 
patients. Our experiments show that HNN improves the joint assertion 
classification accuracy as compared to conventional baselines.
