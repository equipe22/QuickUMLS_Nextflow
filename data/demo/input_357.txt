BACKGROUND: This article describes a high-recall, high-precision approach for 
the extraction of biomedical entities from scientific articles.
METHOD: The approach uses a two-stage pipeline, combining a dictionary-based 
entity recognizer with a machine-learning classifier. First, the OGER entity 
recognizer, which has a bias towards high recall, annotates the terms that 
appear in selected domain ontologies. Subsequently, the Distiller framework uses 
this information as a feature for a machine learning algorithm to select the 
relevant entities only. For this step, we compare two different supervised 
machine-learning algorithms: Conditional Random Fields and Neural Networks.
RESULTS: In an in-domain evaluation using the CRAFT corpus, we test the 
performance of the combined systems when recognizing chemicals, cell types, 
cellular components, biological processes, molecular functions, organisms, 
proteins, and biological sequences. Our best system combines dictionary-based 
candidate generation with Neural-Network-based filtering. It achieves an overall 
precision of 86% at a recall of 60% on the named entity recognition task, and a 
precision of 51% at a recall of 49% on the concept recognition task.
CONCLUSION: These results are to our knowledge the best reported so far in this 
particular task.
