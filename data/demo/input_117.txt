The growing amount and availability of electronic health record (EHR) data 
present enhanced opportunities for discovering new knowledge about diseases. In 
the past decade, there has been an increasing number of data and text mining 
studies focused on the identification of disease associations (e.g., 
disease-disease, disease-drug, and disease-gene) in structured and unstructured 
EHR data. This chapter presents a knowledge discovery framework for mining the 
EHR for disease knowledge and describes each step for data selection, 
preprocessing, transformation, data mining, and interpretation/validation. 
Topics including natural language processing, standards, and data privacy and 
security are also discussed in the context of this framework.
