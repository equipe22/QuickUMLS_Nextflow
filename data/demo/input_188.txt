BACKGROUND: In general, surgical pathology reviews report protein expression by 
tumors in a semi-quantitative manner, that is, -, -/+, +/-, +. At the same time, 
the experimental pathology literature provides multiple examples of precise 
expression levels determined by immunohistochemical (IHC) tissue examination of 
populations of tumors. Natural language processing (NLP) techniques enable the 
automated extraction of such information through text mining. We propose 
establishing a database linking quantitative protein expression levels with 
specific tumor classifications through NLP.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our method takes advantage of typical forms of 
representing experimental findings in terms of percentages of protein expression 
manifest by the tumor population under study. Characteristically, percentages 
are represented straightforwardly with the % symbol or as the number of positive 
findings of the total population. Such text is readily recognized using regular 
expressions and templates permitting extraction of sentences containing these 
forms for further analysis using grammatical structures and rule-based 
algorithms.
RESULTS: Our pilot study is limited to the extraction of such information 
related to lymphomas. We achieved a satisfactory level of retrieval as reflected 
in scores of 69.91% precision and 57.25% recall with an F-score of 62.95%. In 
addition, we demonstrate the utility of a web-based curation tool for confirming 
and correcting our findings.
CONCLUSIONS: The experimental pathology literature represents a rich source of 
pathobiological information, which has been relatively underutilized. There has 
been a combinatorial explosion of knowledge within the pathology domain as 
represented by increasing numbers of immunophenotypes and disease 
subclassifications. NLP techniques support practical text mining techniques for 
extracting this knowledge and organizing it in forms appropriate for pathology 
decision support systems.
