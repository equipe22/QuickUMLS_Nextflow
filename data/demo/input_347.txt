In scoping reviews, boundaries of relevant evidence may be initially fuzzy, with 
refined conceptual understanding of interventions and their proposed mechanisms 
of action an intended output of the scoping process rather than its starting 
point. Electronic searches are therefore sensitive, often retrieving very large 
record sets that are impractical to screen in their entirety. This paper 
describes methods for applying and evaluating the use of text mining (TM) 
technologies to reduce impractical screening workload in reviews, using examples 
of two extremely large-scale scoping reviews of public health evidence (choice 
architecture (CA) and economic environment (EE)). Electronic searches retrieved 
>800,000 (CA) and >1 million (EE) records. TM technologies were used to 
prioritise records for manual screening. TM performance was measured 
prospectively. TM reduced manual screening workload by 90% (CA) and 88% (EE) 
compared with conventional screening (absolute reductions of ≈430 000 (CA) and 
≈378 000 (EE) records). This study expands an emerging corpus of empirical 
evidence for the use of TM to expedite study selection in reviews. By reducing 
screening workload to manageable levels, TM made it possible to assemble and 
configure large, complex evidence bases that crossed research discipline 
boundaries. These methods are transferable to other scoping and systematic 
reviews incorporating conceptual development or explanatory dimensions.
