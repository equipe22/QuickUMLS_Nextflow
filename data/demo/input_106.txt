Text mining of scientific libraries and social media has already proven itself 
as a reliable tool for drug repurposing and hypothesis generation. The task of 
mapping a disease mention to a concept in a controlled vocabulary, typically to 
the standard thesaurus in the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), is known 
as medical concept normalization. This task is challenging due to the 
differences in the use of medical terminology between health care professionals 
and social media texts coming from the lay public. To bridge this gap, we use 
sequence learning with recurrent neural networks and semantic representation of 
one- or multi-word expressions: we develop end-to-end architectures directly 
tailored to the task, including bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory, Gated 
Recurrent Units with an attention mechanism, and additional semantic similarity 
features based on UMLS. Our evaluation against a standard benchmark shows that 
recurrent neural networks improve results over an effective baseline for 
classification based on convolutional neural networks. A qualitative examination 
of mentions discovered in a dataset of user reviews collected from popular 
online health information platforms as well as a quantitative evaluation both 
show improvements in the semantic representation of health-related expressions 
in social media.
