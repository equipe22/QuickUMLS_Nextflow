The United States lacks a system to use routinely collected electronic health 
record (EHR) clinical data to conduct comparative effectiveness research (CER) 
on pediatric drug therapeutics and other child health topics. This Special 
Article describes the creation and details of a network of EHR networks devised 
to use clinical data in EHRs for conducting CER, led by the American Academy of 
Pediatrics Pediatric Research in Office Settings (PROS). To achieve this goal, 
PROS has linked data from its own EHR-based "ePROS" network with data from 
independent practices and health systems across the United States. Beginning 
with 4 of proof-of-concept retrospective CER studies on psychotropic and asthma 
medication use and side effects with a planned full-scale prospective CER study 
on treatment of pediatric hypertension, the Comparative Effectiveness Research 
Through Collaborative Electronic Reporting (CER(2)) collaborators are developing 
a platform to advance the methodology of pediatric pharmacoepidemiology. CER(2) 
will provide a resource for future CER studies in pediatric drug therapeutics 
and other child health topics. This article outlines the vision for and present 
composition of this network, governance, and challenges and opportunities for 
using the network to advance child health and health care. The goal of this 
network is to engage child health researchers from around the United States in 
participating in collaborative research using the CER(2) database.
