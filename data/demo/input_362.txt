Arguably, the richest source of knowledge (as opposed to fact and data 
collections) about biology and biotechnology is captured in natural-language 
documents such as technical reports, conference proceedings and research 
articles. The automatic exploitation of this rich knowledge base for decision 
making, hypothesis management (generation and testing) and knowledge discovery 
constitutes a formidable challenge. Recently, a set of technologies collectively 
referred to as knowledge discovery in text (KDT) has been advocated as a 
promising approach to tackle this challenge. KDT comprises three main tasks: 
information retrieval, information extraction and text mining. These tasks are 
the focus of much recent scientific research and many algorithms have been 
developed and applied to documents and text in biology and biotechnology. This 
article introduces the basic concepts of KDT, provides an overview of some of 
these efforts in the field of bioscience and biotechnology, and presents a 
framework of commonly used techniques for evaluating KDT methods, tools and 
systems.
