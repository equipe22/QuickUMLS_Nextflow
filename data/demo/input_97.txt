This demonstration showcase will present a novel open access text mining 
application called NimbleMiner. NimbleMiner's architecture is language agnostic 
and it can be potentially applied in multiple languages. The system was applied 
in a series of recent studies in several languages, including English and 
Hebrew. The system showed good results in terms of text classification 
performance when compared to other natural language processing approaches.
