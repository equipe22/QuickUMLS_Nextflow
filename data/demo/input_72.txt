Background: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States and the 
European Medicines Agency (EMA) have recognized social media as a new data 
source to strengthen their activities regarding drug safety. Objective: Our 
objective in the ADR-PRISM project was to provide text mining and visualization 
tools to explore a corpus of posts extracted from social media. We evaluated 
this approach on a corpus of 21 million posts from five patient forums, and 
conducted a qualitative analysis of the data available on methylphenidate in 
this corpus. Methods: We applied text mining methods based on named entity 
recognition and relation extraction in the corpus, followed by signal detection 
using proportional reporting ratio (PRR). We also used topic modeling based on 
the Correlated Topic Model to obtain the list of the matics in the corpus and 
classify the messages based on their topics. Results: We automatically 
identified 3443 posts about methylphenidate published between 2007 and 2016, 
among which 61 adverse drug reactions (ADR) were automatically detected. Two 
pharmacovigilance experts evaluated manually the quality of automatic 
identification, and a f-measure of 0.57 was reached. Patient's reports were 
mainly neuro-psychiatric effects. Applying PRR, 67% of the ADRs were signals, 
including most of the neuro-psychiatric symptoms but also palpitations. Topic 
modeling showed that the most represented topics were related to Childhood and 
Treatment initiation, but also Side effects. Cases of misuse were also 
identified in this corpus, including recreational use and abuse. Conclusion: 
Named entity recognition combined with signal detection and topic modeling have 
demonstrated their complementarity in mining social media data. An in-depth 
analysis focused on methylphenidate showed that this approach was able to detect 
potential signals and to provide better understanding of patients' behaviors 
regarding drugs, including misuse.
