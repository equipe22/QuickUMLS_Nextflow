To build a semantically interoperable Electronic Health Record is one of the 
most challenging research fields in health informatics. In order to reach this 
objective, EHR standards that formally describe health data structures have to 
be used. CEN EN13606 is one of the most promising approaches. It covers the 
technical needs for semantic interoperability and, at the same time, it 
incorporates a mechanism (archetype model) that enables clinical domain experts 
to participate in building an EHR system. In this paper we present EHRflex, a 
generic system based on archetypes. It empowers the clinician and allows him to 
manage his own EHR system in a simple and generic way, assuring that the user 
works with underlying standardized data structures. These can be exchanged with 
other people and systems when needed. EHRflex introduces EHR standards into the 
clinical routine delivering a technical platform which works directly on 
archetype based data.
