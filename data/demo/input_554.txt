Computer systems and communication technologies are making a strong and 
influential presence in the different fields of medicine. The cornerstone of a 
functional medical information system represents the electronic health records 
management system. Due to a very sensitive nature of medical information, such 
systems are faced with a number of stringent requirements, like security and 
confidentiality of patients' related data, different media type's management, 
diversity of medical data that need to be processed etc. At present most 
clinical software systems are closed with little or no operability between them, 
and the medical information are locked in a variety of different incompatible 
databases. As the result of these facts, it is very hard for the developers to 
provide the solution for an integrated health computing environment, which would 
considerably improve the quality of medical care in general. This paper presents 
the framework for a functional EHR management system that meets these demands, 
but also follows the initiative taken by the Next Generation Network (NGN) 
approach, which includes user mobility, service transparency and common 
communication platform for transferring and serving different types of 
information, services and media.
