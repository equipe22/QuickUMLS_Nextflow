Named entities in the biomedical domain are often written using a Noun Phrase 
(NP) along with a coordinating conjunction such as 'and' and 'or'. In addition, 
repeated words among named entity mentions are frequently omitted. It is often 
difficult to identify named entities. Although various Named Entity Recognition 
(NER) methods have tried to solve this problem, these methods can only deal with 
relatively simple elliptical patterns in coordinated NPs. We propose a new NER 
method for identifying non-elliptical entity mentions with simple or complex 
ellipses using linguistic rules and an entity mention dictionary. The GENIA and 
CRAFT corpora were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed system. The 
GENIA corpus was used to evaluate the performance of the system according to the 
quality of the dictionary. The GENIA corpus comprises 3434 non-elliptical entity 
mentions in 1585 coordinated NPs with ellipses. The system achieves 92.11% 
precision, 95.20% recall, and 93.63% F-score in identification of non-elliptical 
entity mentions in coordinated NPs. The accuracy of the system in resolving 
simple and complex ellipses is 94.54% and 91.95%, respectively. The CRAFT corpus 
was used to evaluate the performance of the system under realistic conditions. 
The system achieved 78.47% precision, 67.10% recall, and 72.34% F-score in 
coordinated NPs. The performance evaluations of the system show that it 
efficiently solves the problem caused by ellipses, and improves NER performance. 
The algorithm is implemented in PHP and the code can be downloaded from
