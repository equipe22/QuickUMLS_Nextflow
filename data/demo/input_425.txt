Existing population health indicators tend to be out-of-date, not fully 
available at local levels of geography, and not developed in a 
coherent/consistent manner, which hinders their use in public health. The PopHR 
platform aims to deliver an electronic repository that contains multiple 
aggregated clinical, administrative, and environmental data sources to provide a 
coherent view of the health status of populations in the province of Quebec, 
Canada. This platform is designed to provide representative information in 
near-real time with high geographical resolution, thereby assisting public 
health professionals, analysts, clinicians and the public in decision-making. 
This paper presents our ongoing efforts to develop an integrated population 
health indicator ontology (PHIO) that captures the knowledge required for 
calculation and interpretation of health indicators within a PopHR semantic 
framework.
