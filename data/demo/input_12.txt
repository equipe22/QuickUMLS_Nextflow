BACKGROUND: We define electronic consultations ("e-consults") as asynchronous, 
consultative, provider-to-provider communications within a shared electronic 
health record (EHR) or web-based platform. E-consults are intended to improve 
access to specialty expertise for patients and providers without the need for a 
face-to-face visit. Our goal was to systematically review and summarize the 
literature describing the use and effects of e-consults.
METHODS: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and CINAHL for 
studies related to e-consults published between 1990 through December 2014. 
Three reviewers identified empirical studies and system descriptions, including 
articles on systems that used a shared EHR or web-based platform, connected 
providers in the same health system, were used for two-way provider 
communication, and were text-based.
RESULTS: Our final review included 27 articles. Twenty-two were research studies 
and five were system descriptions. Eighteen originated from one of three sites 
with well-developed e-consult programs. Most studies reported on workflow 
impact, timeliness of specialty input, and/or provider perceptions of 
e-consults. E-consultations are used in a variety of ways within and across 
medical centers. They provide timely access to specialty care and are 
well-received by primary care providers.
DISCUSSION: E-consults are feasible in a variety of settings, flexible in their 
application, and facilitate timely specialty advice. More extensive and rigorous 
studies are needed to inform the e-consult process and describe its effect on 
access to specialty visits, cost and clinical outcomes.
