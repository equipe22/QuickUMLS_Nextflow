A number of freely available text mining tools have been put together to extract 
highly reliable Drosophila gene interaction data from text. The system has been 
tested with The Interactive Fly, showing low recall (27-34%), but very high 
precision (93-97%).
AVAILABILITY: The extracted data and a web interface for submission of texts to 
GIFT analysis are available at http://gift.cryst.bbk.ac.uk/gift

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Additional documentation, such as the dictionaries 
and the reference sets, are available at the GIFT website.
