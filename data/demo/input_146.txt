Natural language processing (NLP) has been designed to convert narrative text 
into structured data. Although some general NLP architectures have been 
developed, a task-specific NLP framework to facilitate the effective use of data 
is still a challenge in lexical resource limited regions, such as China. The 
purpose of this study is to design and develop a task-specific NLP framework to 
extract targeted information from particular documents by adopting dedicated 
algorithms on current limited lexical resources. In this framework, a shared and 
evolving ontology mechanism was designed. The result has shown that such a free 
text driven platform will accelerate the NLP technology acceptance in China.
