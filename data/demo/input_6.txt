Semantic standards and human language technologies are key enablers for semantic 
interoperability across heterogeneous document and data collections in clinical 
information systems. Data provenance is awarded increasing attention, and it is 
especially critical where clinical data are automatically extracted from 
original documents, e.g. by text mining. This paper demonstrates how the output 
of a commercial clinical text-mining tool can be harmonised with FHIR, the 
leading clinical information model standard. Character ranges that indicate the 
origin of an annotation and machine generates confidence values were identified 
as crucial elements of data provenance in order to enrich text-mining results. 
We have specified and requested necessary extensions to the FHIR standard and 
demonstrated how, as a result, important metadata describing processes 
generating FHIR instances from clinical narratives can be embedded.
