Biomedical text-mining systems have great promise for improving the efficiency 
and productivity of biomedical researchers. However, such systems are still not 
in routine use. One impediment to their development is the lack of systematic 
and rigorous evaluation, comparable to the approaches developed for information 
retrieval systems. The developers of text-mining systems need to improve both 
test collections for system-oriented evaluation and undertake user-oriented 
evaluations to determine the most effective use of their systems for their 
intended audience.
