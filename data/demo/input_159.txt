One of the fastest-growing fields in bioinformatics is text mining: the 
application of natural language processing techniques to problems of knowledge 
management and discovery, using large collections of biological or biomedical 
text such as MEDLINE. The techniques used in text mining range from the very 
simple (e.g., the inference of relationships between genes from frequent 
proximity in documents) to the complex and computationally intensive (e.g., the 
analysis of sentence structures with parsers in order to extract facts about 
protein-protein interactions from statements in the text). This chapter presents 
a general introduction to some of the key principles and challenges of natural 
language processing, and introduces some of the tools available to end-users and 
developers. A case study describes the construction and testing of a simple tool 
designed to tackle a task that is crucial to almost any application of text 
mining in bioinformatics--identifying gene/protein names in text and mapping 
them onto records in an external database.
