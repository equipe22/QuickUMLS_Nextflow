OBJECTIVE: As clinical text mining continues to mature, its potential as an 
enabling technology for innovations in patient care and clinical research is 
becoming a reality. A critical part of that process is rigid benchmark testing 
of natural language processing methods on realistic clinical narrative. In this 
paper, the authors describe the design and performance of three state-of-the-art 
text-mining applications from the National Research Council of Canada on 
evaluations within the 2010 i2b2 challenge.
DESIGN: The three systems perform three key steps in clinical information 
extraction: (1) extraction of medical problems, tests, and treatments, from 
discharge summaries and progress notes; (2) classification of assertions made on 
the medical problems; (3) classification of relations between medical concepts. 
Machine learning systems performed these tasks using large-dimensional bags of 
features, as derived from both the text itself and from external sources: UMLS, 
cTAKES, and Medline.
MEASUREMENTS: Performance was measured per subtask, using micro-averaged 
F-scores, as calculated by comparing system annotations with ground-truth 
annotations on a test set.
RESULTS: The systems ranked high among all submitted systems in the competition, 
with the following F-scores: concept extraction 0.8523 (ranked first); assertion 
detection 0.9362 (ranked first); relationship detection 0.7313 (ranked second).
CONCLUSION: For all tasks, we found that the introduction of a wide range of 
features was crucial to success. Importantly, our choice of machine learning 
algorithms allowed us to be versatile in our feature design, and to introduce a 
large number of features without overfitting and without encountering 
computing-resource bottlenecks.
