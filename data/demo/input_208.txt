*: Background Consisting of dictated free-text documents such as discharge 
summaries, medical narratives are widely used in medical natural language 
processing. Relationships between anatomical entities and human body parts are 
crucial for building medical text mining applications. To achieve this, we 
establish a mapping system consisting of a Wikipedia-based scoring algorithm and 
a named entity normalization method (NEN). The mapping system makes full use of 
information available on Wikipedia, which is a comprehensive Internet medical 
knowledge base. We also built a new ontology, Tree of Human Body Parts (THBP), 
from core anatomical parts by referring to anatomical experts and Unified 
Medical Language Systems (UMLS) to make the mapping system efficacious for 
clinical treatments. *: Result The gold standard is derived from 50 discharge 
summaries from our previous work, in which 2,224 anatomical entities are 
included. The F1-measure of the baseline system is 70.20%, while our algorithm 
based on Wikipedia achieves 86.67% with the assistance of NEN. *: Conclusions We 
construct a framework to map anatomical entities to THBP ontology using 
normalization and a scoring algorithm based on Wikipedia. The proposed framework 
is proven to be much more effective and efficient than the main baseline system.
