HL7 International's Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard 
provides a common format for sharing health data (eg, FHIR resources) and a 
RESTful Application Programming Interface (eg, FHIR API) for accessing those 
resources via a FHIR server connected to an electronic health record system or 
any other system storing clinical data. Substitutable Medical Applications and 
Reusable Technologies (SMART) leverages FHIR to create an electronic health 
record (EHR) agnostic app platform. It utilizes the OAuth standard to provide 
for authorization and authentication. This paper describes the development and 
informal evaluation of Case Based Learning on FHIR (CBL on FHIR), a prototype 
EHR-connected FHIR/SMART platform to provide interactive digital cases for use 
in medical education. The project goals were to provide a more interactive form 
of CBL than is possible on paper to more realistically simulate clinical 
decision making and to expose medical students to modern informatics systems and 
tools for use in patient care.
