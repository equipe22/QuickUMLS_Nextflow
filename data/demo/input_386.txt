We introduce a novel framework of electronic healthcare enabled by a Cloud 
platform able to host both Hospital Information Systems (HIS) and Electronic 
Medical Record (EMR) systems and implement an innovative model of Electronic 
Health Record (EHR) that is not only patient-oriented but also supports a better 
governance of the whole healthcare system. The proposed EHR model adopts the 
state of the art of the Cloud technologies, being able to join the different 
clinical data of the patient stored within the HISs and EMRs either placed into 
a local Data Center or hosted into a Cloud Platform enabling new directions of 
data analysis.
