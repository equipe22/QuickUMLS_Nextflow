Analysis of patient genomes and transcriptomes routinely recognizes new gene 
sets associated with human disease. Here we present an integrative natural 
language processing system which infers common functions for a gene set through 
automatic mining of the scientific literature with biological networks. This 
system links genes with associated literature phrases and combines these links 
with protein interactions in a single heterogeneous network. Multiscale 
functional annotations are inferred based on network distances between phrases 
and genes and then visualized as an ontology of biological concepts. To evaluate 
this system, we predict functions for gene sets representing known pathways and 
find that our approach achieves substantial improvement over the conventional 
text-mining baseline method. Moreover, our system discovers novel annotations 
for gene sets or pathways without previously known functions. Two case studies 
demonstrate how the system is used in discovery of new cancer-related pathways 
with ontological annotations.
