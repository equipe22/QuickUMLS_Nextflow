BACKGROUND: An effective literature search strategy is critical to achieving the 
aims of Sex and Gender Specific Health (SGSH): to understand sex and gender 
differences through research and to effectively incorporate the new knowledge 
into the clinical decision making process to benefit both male and female 
patients. The goal of this project was to develop and validate an SGSH 
literature search tool that is readily and freely available to clinical 
researchers and practitioners.
METHODS: PubMed, a freely available search engine for the Medline database, was 
selected as the platform to build the SGSH literature search tool. Combinations 
of Medical Subject Heading terms, text words, and title words were evaluated for 
optimal specificity and sensitivity. The search tool was then validated against 
reference bases compiled for two disease states, diabetes and stroke.
RESULTS: Key sex and gender terms and limits were bundled to create a search 
tool to facilitate PubMed SGSH literature searches. During validation, the 
search tool retrieved 50 of 94 (53.2%) stroke and 62 of 95 (65.3%) diabetes 
reference articles selected for validation. A general keyword search of stroke 
or diabetes combined with sex difference retrieved 33 of 94 (35.1%) stroke and 
22 of 95 (23.2%) diabetes reference base articles, with lower sensitivity and 
specificity for SGSH content.
CONCLUSIONS: The Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center SGSH PubMed Search 
Tool provides higher sensitivity and specificity to sex and gender specific 
health literature. The tool will facilitate research, clinical decision-making, 
and guideline development relevant to SGSH.
