The National Library of Medicine has developed a tool to identify medical 
concepts from the Unified Medical Language System in free text. This tool - 
MetaMap (and its java version MMTx) has been used extensively for biomedical 
text mining applications. We have developed a module for MetaMap which has a 
high performance in terms of processing speed. We evaluated our module 
independently against MetaMap for the task of identifying UMLS concepts in free 
text clinical radiology reports. A set of 1000 sentences from neuro-radiology 
reports were collected and processed using our technique and the MMTx Program. 
An evaluation showed that our technique was able to identify 91% of the concepts 
found by MMTx in 14% of the time taken by MMTx. An error analysis showed that 
the missing concepts were largely those which were not direct lexical matches 
but inferential matches of multiple concepts. Our method also identified 
multi-phrase concepts which MMTx failed to identify. We suggest that this module 
be implemented as an option in MMTx for real-time text mining applications where 
single concepts found in the UMLS need to be identified.
