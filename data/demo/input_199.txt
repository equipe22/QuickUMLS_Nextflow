In this paper we describe an efficient tool based on natural language processing 
for classifying the detail state of pulmonary embolism (PE) recorded in CT 
pulmonary angiography reports. The classification tasks include: PE present vs. 
absent, acute PE vs. others, central PE vs. others, and subsegmental PE vs. 
others. Statistical learning algorithms were trained with features extracted 
using the NLP tool and gold standard labels obtained via chart review from two 
radiologists. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) 
for the four tasks were 0.998, 0.945, 0.987, and 0.986, respectively. We 
compared our classifiers with bag-of-words Naive Bayes classifiers, a standard 
text mining technology, which gave AUC 0.942, 0.765, 0.766, and 0.712, 
respectively.
