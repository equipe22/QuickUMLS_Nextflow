The interchange of electronic health records between healthcare providers and 
public health organizations has become an increasingly desirable tool in 
reducing healthcare costs, improving healthcare quality, and protecting 
population health. Assuring privacy and security in nationwide sharing of 
Electronic Health Records (EHR) in an environment such as GRID has become a top 
challenge and concern. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) 
and The Science Application International Corporation (SAIC) have jointly 
conducted a proof of concept study to find and build a common secure and 
reliable messaging platform (the SRM Platform) to handle this challenge. The SRM 
Platform is built on the open standards of OASIS, World Wide Web Consortium 
(W3C) web-services standards, and Web Services Interoperability (WS-I) 
specifications to provide the secure transport of sensitive EHR or electronic 
medical records (EMR). Transmitted data may be in any digital form including 
text, data, and binary files, such as images. This paper identifies the business 
use cases, architecture, test results, and new connectivity options for 
disparate health networks among PHIN, NHIN, Grid, and others.
