Microarray gene expression analysis is a powerful high-throughput technique that 
enables researchers to monitor the expression of thousands of genes 
simultaneously. Using this methodology huge amounts of data are produced which 
have to be analysed. Clustering algorithms are used to group genes together 
based on a predefined distance measure. However, clustering algorithms do not 
necessarily group the genes in a biological meaningful way. Additional 
information is needed to improve the identification of disease relevant genes. 
The primary objective of our project is to support the analysis of microarray 
gene expression data by construction of gene relation networks (GRNs). Required 
information can not be found in a structured representation like a database. In 
contrast, a large number of relations are described in biomedical literature. 
The main outcome of this project is the implementation of a software system that 
provides clinicians and researchers with a tool that supports the analysis of 
microarray gene expression data by mapping known relationships from the 
biomedical literature to local gene expression experiments.
