Accurate semantic classification is valuable for text mining and knowledge-based 
tasks that perform inference based on semantic classes. To benefit applications 
using the semantic classification of the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) 
concepts, we automatically reclassified the concepts based on their lexical and 
contextual features. The new classification is useful for auditing the original 
UMLS semantic classification and for building biomedical text mining 
applications.
