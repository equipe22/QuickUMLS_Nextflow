OBJECTIVES: To implement a system for unsupervised extraction of tumor stage and 
prognostic data in patients with genitourinary cancers using clinicopathological 
and radiology text.
METHODS: A corpus of 1054 electronic notes (clinician notes, radiology reports 
and pathology reports) was annotated for tumor stage, prostate specific antigen 
(PSA) and Gleason grade. Annotations from five clinicians were reconciled to 
form a gold standard dataset. A training dataset of 386 documents was 
sequestered. The Medtex algorithm was adapted using the training dataset.
RESULTS: Adapted Medtex equaled or exceeded human performance in most 
annotations, except for implicit M stage (F-measure of 0.69 vs 0.84) and PSA 
(0.92 vs 0.96). Overall Medtex performed with an F-measure of 0.86 compared to 
human annotations of 0.92. There was significant inter-observer variability when 
comparing human annotators to the gold standard.
CONCLUSIONS: The Medtex algorithm performed similarly to human annotators for 
extracting stage and prognostic data from varied clinical texts.
