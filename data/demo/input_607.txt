For a variety of reasons including cheap computing, widespread adoption of 
electronic medical records, digitalization of imaging and biosignals, and rapid 
development of novel technologies, the amount of health care data being 
collected, recorded, and stored is increasing at an exponential rate. Yet 
despite these advances, methods for the valid, efficient, and ethical 
utilization of these data remain underdeveloped. Emergency care research, in 
particular, poses several unique challenges in this rapidly evolving field. A 
group of content experts was recently convened to identify research priorities 
related to barriers to the application of data science to emergency care 
research. These recommendations included: 1) developing methods for 
cross-platform identification and linkage of patients; 2) creating central, 
deidentified, open-access databases; 3) improving methodologies for 
visualization and analysis of intensively sampled data; 4) developing methods to 
identify and standardize electronic medical record data quality; 5) improving 
and utilizing natural language processing; 6) developing and utilizing syndrome 
or complaint-based based taxonomies of disease; 7) developing practical and 
ethical framework to leverage electronic systems for controlled trials; 8) 
exploring technologies to help enable clinical trials in the emergency setting; 
and 9) training emergency care clinicians in data science and data scientists in 
emergency care medicine. The background, rationale, and conclusions of these 
recommendations are included in the present article.
