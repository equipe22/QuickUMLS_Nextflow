Text-mining (TM) solutions are developing into efficient services to researchers 
in the biomedical research community. Such solutions have to scale with the 
growing number and size of resources (e.g. available controlled vocabularies), 
with the amount of literature to be processed (e.g. about 17 million documents 
in PubMed) and with the demands of the user community (e.g. different methods 
for fact extraction). These demands motivated the development of a server-based 
solution for literature analysis. Whatizit is a suite of modules that analyse 
text for contained information, e.g. any scientific publication or Medline 
abstracts. Special modules identify terms and then link them to the 
corresponding entries in bioinformatics databases such as UniProtKb/Swiss-Prot 
data entries and gene ontology concepts. Other modules identify a set of 
selected annotation types like the set produced by the EBIMed analysis pipeline 
for proteins. In the case of Medline abstracts, Whatizit offers access to EBI's 
in-house installation via PMID or term query. For large quantities of the user's 
own text, the server can be operated in a streaming mode 
(http://www.ebi.ac.uk/webservices/whatizit).
