Automatic document classification can be valuable in increasing the efficiency 
in updating systematic reviews (SR). In order for the machine learning process 
to work well, it is critical to create and maintain high-quality training 
datasets consisting of expert SR inclusion/exclusion decisions. This task can be 
laborious, especially when the number of topics is large and source data format 
is inconsistent.To approach this problem, we build an automated system to 
streamline the required steps, from initial notification of update in source 
annotation files to loading the data warehouse, along with a web interface to 
monitor the status of each topic. In our current collection of 26 SR topics, we 
were able to standardize almost all of the relevance judgments and recovered 
PMIDs for over 80% of all articles. Of those PMIDs, over 99% were correct in a 
manual random sample study. Our system performs an essential function in 
creating training and evaluation data sets for SR text mining research.
