Nursing records in Taiwan have been computerized, but their quality has rarely 
been discussed. Therefore, this study employed a text-mining approach and a 
cross-sectional retrospective research design to evaluate the quality of 
electronic nursing records at a medical center in Northern Taiwan. SAS Text 
Miner software Version 13.2 was employed to analyze unstructured nursing event 
records. The results show that SAS Text Miner is suitable for developing a 
textmining model for validating nursing records. The sensitivity of SAS Text 
Miner was approximately 0.94, and the specificity and accuracy were 0.99. Thus, 
SAS Text Miner software is an effective tool for auditing unstructured 
electronic nursing records.
