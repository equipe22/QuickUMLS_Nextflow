Healthcare Information Systems are a big business. Currently there is an 
explosion of EHR/EMR products available on the market, and the best tools are 
really expensive. Many developing countries and healthcare providers cannot 
access such tools, and for those who can, there is not a clear strategy for the 
evolution, scaling, and cost of these electronic health products. The lack of 
standard-based implementations conduct to the creation of isolated information 
silos that cannot be exploited (i.e. shared between providers to promote a 
holistic view of each patient's medical history). This paper exposes the main 
elements behind a Standard-based Open Source EHR Platform that is future-proof 
and allows to evolve and scale with minimal cost. The proposed EHR Architecture 
is based on openEHR specifications, adding elements emerged from research and 
development experiences, leading to a design that can be implemented in any 
modern technology. Different implementations will be interoperable by design. 
This Platform will leverage contexts of scarce resources, reusing clinical 
knowledge, a common set of software components and services.
