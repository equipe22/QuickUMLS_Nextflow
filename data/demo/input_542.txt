Increasing interest in and experience with electronic health record (EHR)-driven 
phenotyping has yielded multiple challenges that are at present only partially 
addressed. Many solutions require the adoption of a single software platform, 
often with an additional cost of mapping existing patient and phenotypic data to 
multiple representations. We propose a set of guiding design principles and a 
modular software architecture to bridge the gap to a standardized phenotype 
representation, dissemination and execution. Ongoing development leveraging this 
proposed architecture has shown its ability to address existing limitations.
