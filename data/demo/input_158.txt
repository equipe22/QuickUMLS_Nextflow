In Senegal, great amounts of data are daily generated by medical activities such 
as consultation, hospitalization, blood test, x-ray, birth, death, etc. These 
data are still recorded in register, printed images, audios and movies which are 
manually processed. However, some medical organizations have their own software 
for non-standardized patient record management, appointment, wages, etc. without 
any possibility of sharing these data or communicating with other medical 
structures. This leads to lots of limitations in reusing or sharing these data 
because of their possible structural and semantic heterogeneity. To overcome 
these problems we have proposed a National Medical Information System for 
Senegal (SIMENS). As an integrated platform, SIMENS provides an EHR system that 
supports healthcare activities, a mobile version and a web portal. The SIMENS 
architecture proposes also a data and application integration services for 
supporting interoperability and decision making.
