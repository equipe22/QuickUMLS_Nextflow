People with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) experience reading comprehension 
difficulties, often misinterpreting complex texts, metaphors, and idioms. We 
have developed and tested a new assistive technology tool for adaptive, 
personalized text simplification, called Open Book. This tool is an 
open-sourced, online platform that uses Natural Language Processing with the 
specific aim of assisting reading and aiding understanding of written text for 
people with ASD. The accessibility and effectiveness of Open Book was tested by 
examining the differences in text comprehension scores between the original 
texts and texts that were simplified by Open Book tool, randomly allocated to 
study participants. Two hundred forty-three participants (153 adults and 90 
adolescents) with high-functioning ASD were recruited in the UK, Spain, and 
Bulgaria. Regarding the primary outcome, results showed that both adults and 
adolescents with ASD gave more correct answers for the simplified (M = 11.2, SD 
= 4.1) than original texts (M = 10, SD = 4.1; p < 0.001). This finding was 
consistent across age groups and countries. Regarding the secondary outcome, 
when participants were asked to blindly rate how easy was to understand each 
text, simplified texts were rated as easier (M = 7.6, SD = 2.4) to understand 
than the original texts (M = 8.7, SD = 2.6; p < 0.001). The Open Book software 
seems to have the potential to be a useful tool in assisting reading among 
people with ASD. Our findings support our primary hypothesis that texts 
simplified through Open Book were easier to comprehend compared to original 
texts.
