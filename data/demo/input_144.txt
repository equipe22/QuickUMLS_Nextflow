BACKGROUND: This article describes the approaches taken by the OntoGene group at 
the University of Zurich in dealing with two tasks of the BioCreative III 
competition: classification of articles which contain curatable protein-protein 
interactions (PPI-ACT) and extraction of experimental methods (PPI-IMT).
RESULTS: Two main achievements are described in this paper: (a) a system for 
document classification which crucially relies on the results of an advanced 
pipeline of natural language processing tools; (b) a system which is capable of 
detecting all experimental methods mentioned in scientific literature, and 
listing them with a competitive ranking (AUC iP/R > 0.5).
CONCLUSIONS: The results of the BioCreative III shared evaluation clearly 
demonstrate that significant progress has been achieved in the domain of 
biomedical text mining in the past few years. Our own contribution, together 
with the results of other participants, provides evidence that natural language 
processing techniques have become by now an integral part of advanced text 
mining approaches.
