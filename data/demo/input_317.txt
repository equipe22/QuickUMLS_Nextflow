MOTIVATION: While text mining technologies for biomedical research have gained 
popularity as a way to take advantage of the explosive growth of information in 
text form in biomedical papers, selecting appropriate natural language 
processing (NLP) tools is still difficult for researchers who are not familiar 
with recent advances in NLP. This article provides a comparative evaluation of 
several state-of-the-art natural language parsers, focusing on the task of 
extracting protein-protein interaction (PPI) from biomedical papers. We measure 
how each parser, and its output representation, contributes to accuracy 
improvement when the parser is used as a component in a PPI system.
RESULTS: All the parsers attained improvements in accuracy of PPI extraction. 
The levels of accuracy obtained with these different parsers vary slightly, 
while differences in parsing speed are larger. The best accuracy in this work 
was obtained when we combined Miyao and Tsujii's Enju parser and Charniak and 
Johnson's reranking parser, and the accuracy is better than the state-of-the-art 
results on the same data.
AVAILABILITY: The PPI extraction system used in this work (AkanePPI) is 
available online at 
http://www-tsujii.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/downloads/downloads.cgi. The evaluated 
parsers are also available online from each developer's site.
