In this paper we present a knowledge engineering approach to automatically 
recognize and extract genetic sequences from scientific articles. To carry out 
this task, we use a preliminary recognizer based on a finite state machine to 
extract all candidate DNA/RNA sequences. The latter are then fed into a 
knowledge-based system that automatically discards false positives and refines 
noisy and incorrectly merged sequences. We created the knowledge base by 
manually analyzing different manuscripts containing genetic sequences. Our 
approach was evaluated using a test set of 211 full-text articles in PDF format 
containing 3134 genetic sequences. For such set, we achieved 87.76% precision 
and 97.70% recall respectively. This method can facilitate different research 
tasks. These include text mining, information extraction, and information 
retrieval research dealing with large collections of documents containing 
genetic sequences.
