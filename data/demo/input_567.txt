The rapid growth of the literature on neuroimaging in humans has led to major 
advances in our understanding of human brain function but has also made it 
increasingly difficult to aggregate and synthesize neuroimaging findings. Here 
we describe and validate an automated brain-mapping framework that uses 
text-mining, meta-analysis and machine-learning techniques to generate a large 
database of mappings between neural and cognitive states. We show that our 
approach can be used to automatically conduct large-scale, high-quality 
neuroimaging meta-analyses, address long-standing inferential problems in the 
neuroimaging literature and support accurate 'decoding' of broad cognitive 
states from brain activity in both entire studies and individual human subjects. 
Collectively, our results have validated a powerful and generative framework for 
synthesizing human neuroimaging data on an unprecedented scale.
