BACKGROUND: Data used for training of deep learning networks usually needs large 
amounts of accurate labels. These labels are usually extracted from reports 
using natural language processing or by time-consuming manual review. The aim of 
this study was therefore to develop and evaluate a workflow for using data from 
structured reports as labels to be used in a deep learning application.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We included all plain anteriorposterior radiographs of 
the ankle for which structured reports were available. A workflow was designed 
and implemented where a script was used to automatically retrieve, convert, and 
anonymize the respective radiographs of cases where fractures were either 
present or absent from the institution's picture archiving and communication 
system (PACS). These images were then used to retrain a pretrained deep 
convolutional neural network. Finally, performance was evaluated on a set of 
previously unseen radiographs.
RESULTS: Once implemented and configured, completion of the whole workflow took 
under 1 h. A total of 157 structured reports were retrieved from the reporting 
platform. For all structured reports, corresponding radiographs were 
successfully retrieved from the PACS and fed into the training process. On an 
unseen validation subset, the model showed a satisfactory performance with an 
area under the curve of 0.850 (95% CI 0.634-1.000) for detection of fractures.
CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that data obtained from structured reports written in 
clinical routine can be used to successfully train deep learning algorithms. 
This highlights the potential role of structured reporting for the future of 
radiology, especially in the context of deep learning.
