We describe a system for the detection of mentions of protein-protein 
interactions in the biomedical scientific literature. The original system was 
developed as a part of the OntoGene project, which focuses on using advanced 
computational linguistic techniques for text mining applications in the 
biomedical domain. In this paper, we focus in particular on the participation to 
the BioCreative II.5 challenge, where the OntoGene system achieved best-ranked 
results. Additionally, we describe a feature-analysis experiment performed after 
the challenge, which shows the unexpected result that one single feature alone 
performs better than the combination of features used in the challenge.
