OBJECTIVE: In biomedicine, there is a wealth of information hidden in 
unstructured narratives such as research articles and clinical reports. To 
exploit these data properly, a word sense disambiguation (WSD) algorithm 
prevents downstream difficulties in the natural language processing applications 
pipeline. Supervised WSD algorithms largely outperform un- or semisupervised and 
knowledge-based methods; however, they train 1 separate classifier for each 
ambiguous term, necessitating a large number of expert-labeled training data, an 
unattainable goal in medical informatics. To alleviate this need, a single model 
that shares statistical strength across all instances and scales well with the 
vocabulary size is desirable.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Built on recent advances in deep learning, our deepBioWSD 
model leverages 1 single bidirectional long short-term memory network that makes 
sense prediction for any ambiguous term. In the model, first, the Unified 
Medical Language System sense embeddings will be computed using their text 
definitions; and then, after initializing the network with these embeddings, it 
will be trained on all (available) training data collectively. This method also 
considers a novel technique for automatic collection of training data from 
PubMed to (pre)train the network in an unsupervised manner.
RESULTS: We use the MSH WSD dataset to compare WSD algorithms, with macro and 
micro accuracies employed as evaluation metrics. deepBioWSD outperforms existing 
models in biomedical text WSD by achieving the state-of-the-art performance of 
96.82% for macro accuracy.
CONCLUSIONS: Apart from the disambiguation improvement and unsupervised 
training, deepBioWSD depends on considerably less number of expert-labeled data 
as it learns the target and the context terms jointly. These merit deepBioWSD to 
be conveniently deployable in real-time biomedical applications.
