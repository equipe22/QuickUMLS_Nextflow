Data variability is a commonly observed phenomenon in Electronic Health Records 
(EHR) data networks. A common question asked in scientific investigations of EHR 
data is whether the cross-site and -time variability reflects an underlying data 
quality error at one or more contributing sites versus actual differences driven 
by various idiosyncrasies in the healthcare settings. Although research analysts 
and data scientists have commonly used various statistical methods to detect and 
account for variability in analytic datasets, self service tools to facilitate 
exploring cross-organizational variability in EHR data warehouses are lacking 
and could benefit from meaningful data visualizations. DQe-v, an interactive, 
database-agnostic tool for visually exploring variability in EHR data provides 
such a solution. DQe-v is built on an open source platform, R statistical 
software, with annotated scripts and a readme document that makes it fully 
reproducible. To illustrate and describe functionality of DQe-v, we describe the 
DQe-v's readme document which includes a complete guide to installation, running 
the program, and interpretation of the outputs. We also provide annotated R 
scripts and an example dataset as supplemental materials. DQe-v offers a self 
service tool to visually explore data variability within EHR datasets 
irrespective of the data model. GitHub and CIELO offer hosting and distribution 
of the tool and can facilitate collaboration across any interested community of 
users as we target improving usability, efficiency, and interoperability.
