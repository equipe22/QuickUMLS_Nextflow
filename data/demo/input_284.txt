OBJECTIVE: Identification of clinical events (eg, problems, tests, treatments) 
and associated temporal expressions (eg, dates and times) are key tasks in 
extracting and managing data from electronic health records. As part of the i2b2 
2012 Natural Language Processing for Clinical Data challenge, we developed and 
evaluated a system to automatically extract temporal expressions and events from 
clinical narratives. The extracted temporal expressions were additionally 
normalized by assigning type, value, and modifier.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The system combines rule-based and machine learning 
approaches that rely on morphological, lexical, syntactic, semantic, and 
domain-specific features. Rule-based components were designed to handle the 
recognition and normalization of temporal expressions, while conditional random 
fields models were trained for event and temporal recognition.
RESULTS: The system achieved micro F scores of 90% for the extraction of 
temporal expressions and 87% for clinical event extraction. The normalization 
component for temporal expressions achieved accuracies of 84.73% (expression's 
type), 70.44% (value), and 82.75% (modifier).
DISCUSSION: Compared to the initial agreement between human annotators (87-89%), 
the system provided comparable performance for both event and temporal 
expression mining. While (lenient) identification of such mentions is 
achievable, finding the exact boundaries proved challenging.
CONCLUSIONS: The system provides a state-of-the-art method that can be used to 
support automated identification of mentions of clinical events and temporal 
expressions in narratives either to support the manual review process or as a 
part of a large-scale processing of electronic health databases.
