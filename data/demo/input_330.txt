This paper proposes a system that automatically extracts CYP protein and 
chemical interactions from journal article abstracts, using natural language 
processing (NLP) and text mining methods. In our system, we employ a maximum 
entropy based learning method, using results from syntactic, semantic, and 
lexical analysis of texts. We first present our system architecture and then 
discuss the data set for training our machine learning based models and the 
methods in building components in our system, such as part of speech (POS) 
tagging, Named Entity Recognition (NER), dependency parsing, and relation 
extraction. An evaluation of the system is conducted at the end, yielding very 
promising results: The POS, dependency parsing, and NER components in our system 
have achieved a very high level of accuracy as measured by precision, ranging 
from 85.9% to 98.5%, and the precision and the recall of the interaction 
extraction component are 76.0% and 82.6%, and for the overall system are 68.4% 
and 72.2%, respectively.
