Nationwide Children's Hospital established an i2b2 (Informatics for Integrating 
Biology & the Bedside) application for sleep disorder cohort identification. 
Discrete data were gleaned from semistructured sleep study reports. The system 
showed to work more efficiently than the traditional manual chart review method, 
and it also enabled searching capabilities that were previously not possible.
OBJECTIVE: We report on the development and implementation of the sleep disorder 
i2b2 cohort identification system using natural language processing of 
semi-structured documents.
METHODS: We developed a natural language processing approach to automatically 
parse concepts and their values from semi-structured sleep study documents. Two 
parsers were developed: a regular expression parser for extracting numeric 
concepts and a NLP based tree parser for extracting textual concepts. Concepts 
were further organized into i2b2 ontologies based on document structures and 
in-domain knowledge.
RESULTS: 26,550 concepts were extracted with 99% being textual concepts. 1.01 
million facts were extracted from sleep study documents such as demographic 
information, sleep study lab results, medications, procedures, diagnoses, among 
others. The average accuracy of terminology parsing was over 83% when comparing 
against those by experts. The system is capable of capturing both standard and 
non-standard terminologies. The time for cohort identification has been reduced 
significantly from a few weeks to a few seconds.
CONCLUSION: Natural language processing was shown to be powerful for quickly 
converting large amount of semi-structured or unstructured clinical data into 
discrete concepts, which in combination of intuitive domain specific ontologies, 
allows fast and effective interactive cohort identification through the i2b2 
platform for research and clinical use.
