With the introduction of EHR two-level modelling and archetype methodologies 
pioneered by openEHR and standardized by CEN/ISO, we are one step closer to 
semantic interoperability and future-proof adaptive healthcare information 
systems. Along with the opportunities, there are also challenges. Archetypes 
provide the full semantics of EHR data explicitly to surrounding systems in a 
platform-independent way, yet it is up to the receiving system to interpret the 
semantics and process the data accordingly. In this paper we propose a design of 
an archetype-based platform-independent testing framework for validating 
implementations of the openEHR archetype formalism as a means of improving 
quality and interoperability of EHRs.
