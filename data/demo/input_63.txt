Structured Product Labels follow an XML-based document markup standard approved 
by the Health Level Seven organization and adopted by the US Food and Drug 
Administration as a mechanism for exchanging medical products information. Their 
current organization makes their secondary use rather challenging. We used the 
Side Effect Resource database and DailyMed to generate a comparison dataset of 
1159 Structured Product Labels. We processed the Adverse Reaction section of 
these Structured Product Labels with the Event-based Text-mining of Health 
Electronic Records system and evaluated its ability to extract and encode 
Adverse Event terms to Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities Preferred 
Terms. A small sample of 100 labels was then selected for further analysis. Of 
the 100 labels, Event-based Text-mining of Health Electronic Records achieved a 
precision and recall of 81 percent and 92 percent, respectively. This study 
demonstrated Event-based Text-mining of Health Electronic Record's ability to 
extract and encode Adverse Event terms from Structured Product Labels which may 
potentially support multiple pharmacoepidemiological tasks.
