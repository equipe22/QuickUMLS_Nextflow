OBJECTIVES:  To summarize key contributions to current research in the field of 
Clinical Research Informatics (CRI) and to select best papers published in 2017.
METHOD:  A bibliographic search using a combination of MeSH descriptors and free 
terms on CRI was performed using PubMed, followed by a double-blind review in 
order to select a list of candidate best papers to be then peer-reviewed by 
external reviewers. A consensus meeting between the two section editors and the 
editorial team was organized to finally conclude on the selection of best 
papers.
RESULTS:  Among the 741 returned papers published in 2017 in the various areas 
of CRI, the full review process selected five best papers. The first best paper 
reports on the implementation of consent management considering patient 
preferences for the use of de-identified data of electronic health records for 
research. The second best paper describes an approach using natural language 
processing to extract symptoms of severe mental illness from clinical text. The 
authors of the third best paper describe the challenges and lessons learned when 
leveraging the EHR4CR platform to support patient inclusion in academic studies 
in the context of an important collaboration between private industry and public 
health institutions. The fourth best paper describes a method and an interactive 
tool for case-crossover analyses of electronic medical records for patient 
safety. The last best paper proposes a new method for bias reduction in 
association studies using electronic health records data.
CONCLUSIONS:  Research in the CRI field continues to accelerate and to mature, 
leading to tools and platforms deployed at national or international scales with 
encouraging results. Beyond securing these new platforms for exploiting 
large-scale health data, another major challenge is the limitation of biases 
related to the use of "real-world" data. Controlling these biases is a 
prerequisite for the development of learning health systems.
