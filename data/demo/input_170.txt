Due to the overwhelming volume of published scientific papers, information tools 
for automated literature analysis are essential to support current biomedical 
research. We have developed a knowledge extraction tool to help researcher in 
discovering useful information which can support their reasoning process. The 
tool is composed of a search engine based on Text Mining and Natural Language 
Processing techniques, and an analysis module which process the search results 
in order to build annotation similarity networks. We tested our approach on the 
available knowledge about the genetic mechanism of cardiac diseases, where the 
target is to find both known and possible hypothetical relations between 
specific candidate genes and the trait of interest. We show that the system i) 
is able to effectively retrieve medical concepts and genes and ii) plays a 
relevant role assisting researchers in the formulation and evaluation of novel 
literature-based hypotheses.
