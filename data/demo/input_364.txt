Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death in both the UK and 
worldwide. The detection of related risk factors and tracking their progress 
over time is of great importance for early prevention and treatment of CAD. This 
paper describes an information extraction system that was developed to 
automatically identify risk factors for heart disease in medical records while 
the authors participated in the 2014 i2b2/UTHealth NLP Challenge. Our approaches 
rely on several nature language processing (NLP) techniques such as machine 
learning, rule-based methods, and dictionary-based keyword spotting to cope with 
complicated clinical contexts inherent in a wide variety of risk factors. Our 
system achieved encouraging performance on the challenge test data with an 
overall micro-averaged F-measure of 0.915, which was competitive to the best 
system (F-measure of 0.927) of this challenge task.
