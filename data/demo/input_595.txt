BACKGROUND: Traditional survey methods are limited in the study of hidden 
populations due to the hard to access properties, including lack of a sampling 
frame, sensitivity issue, reporting error, small sample size, etc. The rapid 
increase of online communities, of which members interact with others via the 
Internet, have generated large amounts of data, offering new opportunities for 
understanding hidden populations with unprecedented sample sizes and richness of 
information. In this study, we try to understand the multidimensional 
characteristics of a hidden population by analyzing the massive data generated 
in the online community.
METHODS: By elaborately designing crawlers, we retrieved a complete dataset from 
the "HIV bar," the largest bar related to HIV on the Baidu Tieba platform, for 
all records from January 2005 to August 2016. Through natural language 
processing and social network analysis, we explored the psychology, behavior and 
demand of online HIV population and examined the network community structure.
RESULTS: In HIV communities, the average topic similarity among members is 
positively correlated to network efficiency (r = 0.70, p < 0.001), indicating 
that the closer the social distance between members of the community, the more 
similar their topics. The proportion of negative users in each community is 
around 60%, weakly correlated with community size (r = 0.25, p = 0.002). It is 
found that users suspecting initial HIV infection or first in contact with 
high-risk behaviors tend to seek help and advice on the social networking 
platform, rather than immediately going to a hospital for blood tests.
CONCLUSIONS: Online communities have generated copious amounts of data offering 
new opportunities for understanding hidden populations with unprecedented sample 
sizes and richness of information. It is recommended that support through online 
services for HIV/AIDS consultation and diagnosis be improved to avoid privacy 
concerns and social discrimination in China.
