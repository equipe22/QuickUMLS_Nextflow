BACKGROUND: Most US health care providers have adopted electronic health records 
(EHRs) that facilitate the uniform collection of clinical information. However, 
standardized data formats to capture social and behavioral determinants of 
health (SBDH) in structured EHR fields are still evolving and not adopted 
widely. Consequently, at the point of care, SBDH data are often documented 
within unstructured EHR fields that require time-consuming and subjective 
methods to retrieve. Meanwhile, collecting SBDH data using traditional surveys 
on a large sample of patients is infeasible for health care providers attempting 
to rapidly incorporate SBDH data in their population health management efforts. 
A potential approach to facilitate targeted SBDH data collection is applying 
information extraction methods to EHR data to prescreen the population for 
identification of immediate social needs.
OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to examine the availability and characteristics of SBDH 
data captured in the EHR of a multilevel academic health care system that 
provides both inpatient and outpatient care to patients with varying SBDH across 
Maryland.
METHODS: We measured the availability of selected patient-level SBDH in both 
structured and unstructured EHR data. We assessed various SBDH including 
demographics, preferred language, alcohol use, smoking status, social connection 
and/or isolation, housing issues, financial resource strains, and availability 
of a home address. EHR's structured data were represented by information 
collected between January 2003 and June 2018 from 5,401,324 patients. EHR's 
unstructured data represented information captured for 1,188,202 patients 
between July 2016 and May 2018 (a shorter time frame because of limited 
availability of consistent unstructured data). We used text-mining techniques to 
extract a subset of SBDH factors from EHR's unstructured data.
RESULTS: We identified a valid address or zip code for 5.2 million (95.00%) of 
approximately 5.4 million patients. Ethnicity was captured for 2.7 million 
(50.00%), whereas race was documented for 4.9 million (90.00%) and a preferred 
language for 2.7 million (49.00%) patients. Information regarding alcohol use 
and smoking status was coded for 490,348 (9.08%) and 1,728,749 (32.01%) 
patients, respectively. Using the International Classification of Diseases-10th 
Revision diagnoses codes, we identified 35,171 (0.65%) patients with information 
related to social connection/isolation, 10,433 (0.19%) patients with housing 
issues, and 3543 (0.07%) patients with income/financial resource strain. Of 
approximately 1.2 million unique patients with unstructured data, 30,893 (2.60%) 
had at least one clinical note containing phrases referring to social 
connection/isolation, 35,646 (3.00%) included housing issues, and 11,882 (1.00%) 
had mentions of financial resource strain.
CONCLUSIONS: Apart from demographics, SBDH data are not regularly collected for 
patients. Health care providers should assess the availability and 
characteristics of SBDH data in EHRs. Evaluating the quality of SBDH data can 
potentially enable health care providers to modify underlying workflows to 
improve the documentation, collection, and extraction of SBDH data from EHRs.
