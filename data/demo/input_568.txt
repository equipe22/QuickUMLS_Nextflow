The paper describes several classification systems that could improve patient 
safety through semantic interoperability among contemporary electronic health 
record systems (EHR-Ss) with support of the HL7 v3 standard. We describe a 
proposal and a pilot implementation of a semantic interoperability platform 
(SIP) interconnecting current EHR-Ss by using HL7 v3 messages and concepts 
mappings on most widely used classification systems. The increasing number of 
classification systems and nomenclatures requires designing of various 
conversion tools for transfer between main classification systems. We present 
the so-called LIM filler module and the HL7 broker, which are parts of the SIP, 
playing the role of such conversion tools. The analysis of suitability and 
usability of individual terminological thesauri has been started by mapping of 
clinical contents of the Minimal Data Model for Cardiology (MDMC) to various 
terminological classification systems. A national-wide implementation of the SIP 
would include adopting and translating international coding systems and 
nomenclatures, and developing implementation guidelines facilitating the 
migration from national standards to international ones. Our research showed 
that creation of such a platform is feasible; however, it will require a huge 
effort to adapt fully the Czech healthcare system to the European environment.
