The Substitutable Medical Applications, Reusable Technologies (SMART) Platforms 
project ( www.smartplatforms.org ) seeks to develop an iPhone-like health 
information technology platform with substitutable apps constructed around core 
services. It is funded by a grant from the Office of the National Coordinator of 
Health Information Technology's Strategic Health IT Advanced Research Projects 
(SHARP) Program. SMART technologies enable existing electronic health records 
and HIT platforms to run substitutable apps. Substitutability is the capability 
inherent in a system of replacing one application with another of similar 
functionality. We created a patient-facing SMART instance using the open source 
Indivo personally controlled health record (PCHR). The SMART "read-only" API has 
been deployed on multiple systems, including the Cerner installation at Boston 
Children's Hospital and the World Vista EHR. We sought to SMART-enable Indivo, 
the open source reference PCHR upon which HealthVault and other PCHRs were 
modeled. PCHRs provide patients with a secure repository of their health 
information that can be exposed to apps across a programming interface. We 
updated the open source Indivo PCHR to support the SMART API, enabling Indivo to 
act as a patient-facing apps platform, running the same or similar versions of 
apps that face clinicians.
