Phosphorylation is an important biochemical reaction that plays a critical role 
in signal transduction pathways and cell-cycle processes. A text mining system 
to extract the phosphorylation relation from the literature is reported. The 
focus of this paper is on the new methods developed and implemented to connect 
and merge pieces of information about phosphorylation mentioned in different 
sentences in the text. The effectiveness and accuracy of the system as a whole 
as well as that of the methods for extraction beyond a clause/sentence is 
evaluated using an independently annotated dataset, the Phospho.ELM database. 
The new methods developed to merge pieces of information from different 
sentences are shown to be effective in significantly raising the recall without 
much difference in precision.
