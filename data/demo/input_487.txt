The biomedical literature is growing at an ever-increasing rate, which 
pronounces the need to support scientists with advanced, automated means of 
accessing knowledge. We investigate a novel approach employing description 
logics (DL)-based queries made to formal ontologies that have been created using 
the results of text mining full-text research papers. In this paradigm, an 
OWL-DL ontology becomes populated with instances detected through natural 
language processing (NLP). The generated ontology can be queried by biologists 
using DL reasoners or integrated into bioinformatics workflows for further 
automated analyses. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach with a 
system targeting the protein mutation literature.
