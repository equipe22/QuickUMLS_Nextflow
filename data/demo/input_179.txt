Medical reports often contain a lot of relevant information in the form of free 
text. To reuse these unstructured texts for biomedical research, it is important 
to extract structured data from them. In this work, we adapted a previously 
developed information extraction system to the oncology domain, to process a set 
of anatomic pathology reports in the Italian language. The information 
extraction system relies on a domain ontology, which was adapted and refined in 
an iterative way. The final output was evaluated by a domain expert, with 
promising results.
