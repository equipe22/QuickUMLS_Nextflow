OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility of automated dose and adverse event 
information retrieval in supporting the identification of safety patterns.
METHODS: We extracted all rabbit Anti-Thymocyte Globulin (rATG) reports 
submitted to the United States Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event 
Reporting System (FAERS) from the product's initial licensure in April 16, 1984 
through February 8, 2016. We processed the narratives using the Medication 
Extraction (MedEx) and the Event-based Text-mining of Health Electronic Records 
(ETHER) systems and retrieved the appropriate medication, clinical, and temporal 
information. When necessary, the extracted information was manually curated. 
This process resulted in a high quality dataset that was analyzed with the 
Pattern-based and Advanced Network Analyzer for Clinical Evaluation and 
Assessment (PANACEA) to explore the association of rATG dosing with 
post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD).
RESULTS: Although manual curation was necessary to improve the data quality, 
MedEx and ETHER supported the extraction of the appropriate information. We 
created a final dataset of 1,380 cases with complete information for rATG dosing 
and date of administration. Analysis in PANACEA found that PTLD was associated 
with cumulative doses of rATG >8 mg/kg, even in periods where most of the 
submissions to FAERS reported low doses of rATG.
CONCLUSION: We demonstrated the feasibility of investigating a dose-related 
safety pattern for a particular product in FAERS using a set of automated tools.
