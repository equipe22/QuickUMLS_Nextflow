OBJECTIVE: Instruments rating risk of harm to self and others are widely used in 
inpatient forensic psychiatry settings. A potential alternate or supplementary 
means of risk prediction is from the automated analysis of case notes in 
Electronic Health Records (EHRs) using Natural Language Processing (NLP). This 
exploratory study rated presence or absence and frequency of words in a forensic 
EHR dataset, comparing four reference dictionaries. Seven machine learning 
algorithms and different time periods of EHR analysis were used to probe which 
dictionary and which time period were most predictive of risk assessment scores 
on validated instruments.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The EHR dataset comprised de-identified forensic 
inpatient notes from the Wilfred Lopes Centre in Tasmania. The data comprised 
unstructured free-text case note entries and serial ratings of three risk 
assessment scales: Historical Clinical Risk Management-20 (HCR-20), Short-Term 
Assessment of Risk and Treatability (START) and Dynamic Appraisal of Situational 
Aggression (DASA). Four NLP dictionary word lists were selected: 6865 mental 
health symptom words from the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), 455 DSM-IV 
diagnoses from UMLS repository, 6790 English positive and negative sentiment 
words, and 1837 high frequency words from the Corpus of Contemporary American 
English (COCA). Seven machine learning methods Bagging, J48, Jrip, Logistic 
Model Trees (LMT), Logistic Regression, Linear Regression and Support Vector 
Machine (SVM) were used to identify the combination of dictionaries and 
algorithms that best predicted risk assessment scores.
RESULTS: The most accurate prediction was attained on the DASA dataset using the 
sentiment dictionary and the LMT and SVM algorithms.
CONCLUSIONS: NLP, used in conjunction with NLP dictionaries and machine 
learning, predicted risk ratings on the HCR-20, START, and DASA, based on EHR 
content. Further research is required to ascertain the utility of NLP approaches 
in predicting endpoints of actual self-harm, harm to others or victimisation.
