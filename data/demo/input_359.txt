BACKGROUND: As systems biology has begun to draw growing attention, bio-network 
inference and analysis have become more and more important. Though there have 
been many efforts for bio-network inference, they are still far from practical 
applications due to too many false inferences and lack of comprehensible 
interpretation in the biological viewpoints. In order for applying to real 
problems, they should provide effective inference, reliable validation, rational 
elucidation, and sufficient extensibility to incorporate various relevant 
information sources.
RESULTS: We have been developing an information fusion software platform called 
BioCAD. It is utilizing both of local and global optimization for bio-network 
inference, text mining techniques for network validation and annotation, and Web 
services-based workflow techniques. In addition, it includes an effective 
technique to elucidate network edges by integrating various information sources. 
This paper presents the architecture of BioCAD and essential modules for 
bio-network inference and analysis.
CONCLUSION: BioCAD provides a convenient infrastructure for network inference 
and network analysis. It automates series of users' processes by providing data 
preprocessing tools for various formats of data. It also helps inferring more 
accurate and reliable bio-networks by providing network inference tools which 
utilize information from distinct sources. And it can be used to analyze and 
validate the inferred bio-networks using information fusion tools.
