OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the performance of a system that extracts medication 
information and administration-related actions from patient short message 
service (SMS) messages.
DESIGN: Mobile technologies provide a platform for electronic patient-centered 
medication management. MyMediHealth (MMH) is a medication management system that 
includes a medication scheduler, a medication administration record, and a 
reminder engine that sends text messages to cell phones. The object of this work 
was to extend MMH to allow two-way interaction using mobile phone-based SMS 
technology. Unprompted text-message communication with patients using natural 
language could engage patients in their healthcare, but presents unique natural 
language processing challenges. The authors developed a new functional component 
of MMH, the Patient-centered Automated SMS Tagging Engine (PASTE). The PASTE web 
service uses natural language processing methods, custom lexicons, and existing 
knowledge sources to extract and tag medication information from patient text 
messages.
MEASUREMENTS: A pilot evaluation of PASTE was completed using 130 medication 
messages anonymously submitted by 16 volunteers via a website. System output was 
compared with manually tagged messages.
RESULTS: Verified medication names, medication terms, and action terms reached 
high F-measures of 91.3%, 94.7%, and 90.4%, respectively. The overall medication 
name F-measure was 79.8%, and the medication action term F-measure was 90%.
CONCLUSION: Other studies have demonstrated systems that successfully extract 
medication information from clinical documents using semantic tagging, regular 
expression-based approaches, or a combination of both approaches. This 
evaluation demonstrates the feasibility of extracting medication information 
from patient-generated medication messages.
