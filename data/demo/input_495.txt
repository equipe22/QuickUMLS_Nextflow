Based on MeSH-2004, we constructed a Learning Science related phenotype Ontology 
with active server page (ASP) and database technology. It provides a canonical, 
systemic and structural term system for the study of learning science and its 
phenotypes include terms of behavior,psychology and mental disorder. By using 
this Ontology, we can integrate isomerous data. It will increase the efficiency 
of information acquisition, management and search,and provide a platform for 
data sharing and data mining.
