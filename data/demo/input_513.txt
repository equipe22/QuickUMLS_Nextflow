OBJECTIVE: Audio-enhanced computer-assisted self-interviews (ACASIs) are useful 
adjuncts for clinical care but are rarely integrated into the electronic health 
record (EHR). We created a flexible framework for integrating an ACASIs with 
clinical decision support (CDS) into the EHR. We used this program to identify 
adolescents at risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in the emergency 
department (ED). We provide an overview of the software platform and qualitative 
user acceptance.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We created an ACASI with a CDS algorithm to identify 
adolescents in need of STI testing. We offered it to 15- to 21-year-old patients 
in our ED, regardless of ED complaint. We collected user feedback via the ACASI. 
These were programmed into REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture), and an iOS 
application utilizing Apple ResearchKit generated a tablet compatible 
representation of the ACASI for patients. A custom software program created an 
HL7 (Health Level Seven) message containing a summary of responses, CDS 
recommendations, and STI test orders, which were transmitted to the EHR.
RESULTS: In the first year, 1788 of 6227 (28.7%) eligible adolescents completed 
the survey. Technical issues led to decreased use for several months. Patients 
rated the system favorably, with 1583 of 1787 (88.9%) indicating that they were 
"somewhat" or "very comfortable" answering questions electronically and 1291 of 
1787 (72.2%) preferring this format over face-to-face interviews or paper 
questionnaires.
CONCLUSIONS: We present a novel use for REDCap to combine patient-answered 
questionnaires and CDS to improve care for adolescents at risk for STIs. Our 
program was well received and the platform can be used across disparate 
patients, topics, and information technology infrastructures.
