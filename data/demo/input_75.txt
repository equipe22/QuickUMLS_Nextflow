CONTEXT: Blood pressure (BP) is routinely measured in children and adolescents 
during primary care visits. However, elevated BP or hypertension is frequently 
not diagnosed or evaluated further by primary care providers. Barriers to 
recognition include lack of clinician buy-in, competing priorities, and 
complexity of the standard BP tables.
CASE DESCRIPTION: We have developed and piloted TeenBP- a web-based, electronic 
health record (EHR) linked system designed to improve recognition of 
prehypertension and hypertension in adolescents during primary care visits.
MAJOR THEMES: Important steps in developing TeenBP included the following: 
review of national BP guidelines, consideration of clinic workflow, engagement 
of clinical leaders, and evaluation of the impact on clinical sites. Use of a 
web-based platform has facilitated updates to the TeenBP algorithm and to the 
message content. In addition, the web-based platform has allowed for development 
of a sophisticated display of patient-specific information at the point of care. 
In the TeenBP pilot, conducted at a single pediatric and family practice site 
with six clinicians, over a five-month period, more than half of BPs in the 
hypertensive range were clinically recognized. Furthermore, in this small pilot 
the TeenBP clinical decision support (CDS) was accepted by providers and 
clinical staff. Effectiveness of the TeenBP CDS will be determined in a two-year 
cluster-randomized clinical trial, currently underway at 20 primary care sites.
CONCLUSION: Use of technology to extract and display clinically relevant data 
stored within the EHR may be a useful tool for improving recognition of 
adolescent hypertension during busy primary care visits. In the future, the 
methods developed specifically for TeenBP are likely to be translatable to a 
wide range of acute and chronic issues affecting children and adolescents.
