The natural language approach to diagnosis encoding will certainly become a 
widespread technique during the second half of this decade. Accessing standard 
codes by numbers and keywords will be more and more considered a loss of time 
and efficiency. We present a demonstration of a natural language based encoding 
system for ICD, called LUCID, which considerably alleviates the burden of coding 
with ICD classification and enhances the quality of the encoded list of 
diagnoses. This tool, delivered on a PC platform, is very convivial and provides 
a versatile interface to any existing application based on Microsoft Windows 
standards.
