BACKGROUND: Text-mining can assist biomedical researchers in reducing 
information overload by extracting useful knowledge from large collections of 
text. We developed a novel text-mining method based on analyzing the network 
structure created by symbol co-occurrences as a way to extend the capabilities 
of knowledge extraction. The method was applied to the task of automatic gene 
and protein name synonym extraction.
RESULTS: Performance was measured on a test set consisting of about 50,000 
abstracts from one year of MEDLINE. Synonyms retrieved from curated genomics 
databases were used as a gold standard. The system obtained a maximum F-score of 
22.21% (23.18% precision and 21.36% recall), with high efficiency in the use of 
seed pairs.
CONCLUSION: The method performs comparably with other studied methods, does not 
rely on sophisticated named-entity recognition, and requires little initial seed 
knowledge.
