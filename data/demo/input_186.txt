The contribution of the vaccine adverse event text mining system to the 
classification of possible Guillain-Barré syndrome reports.

BACKGROUND: We previously demonstrated that a general purpose text mining 
system, the Vaccine adverse event Text Mining (VaeTM) system, could be used to 
automatically classify reports of an-aphylaxis for post-marketing safety 
surveillance of vaccines.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the ability of VaeTM to classify reports to the Vaccine 
Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) of possible Guillain-Barré Syndrome 
(GBS).
METHODS: We used VaeTM to extract the key diagnostic features from the text of 
reports in VAERS. Then, we applied the Brighton Collaboration (BC) case 
definition for GBS, and an information retrieval strategy (i.e. the vector space 
model) to quantify the specific information that is included in the key features 
extracted by VaeTM and compared it with the encoded information that is already 
stored in VAERS as Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) 
Preferred Terms (PTs). We also evaluated the contribution of the primary 
(diagnosis and cause of death) and secondary (second level diagnosis and 
symptoms) diagnostic VaeTM-based features to the total VaeTM-based information.
RESULTS: MedDRA captured more information and better supported the 
classification of reports for GBS than VaeTM (AUC: 0.904 vs. 0.777); the lower 
performance of VaeTM is likely due to the lack of extraction by VaeTM of 
specific laboratory results that are included in the BC criteria for GBS. On the 
other hand, the VaeTM-based classification exhibited greater specificity than 
the MedDRA-based approach (94.96% vs. 87.65%). Most of the VaeTM-based 
information was contained in the secondary diagnostic features.
CONCLUSION: For GBS, clinical signs and symptoms alone are not sufficient to 
match MedDRA coding for purposes of case classification, but are preferred if 
specificity is the priority.
