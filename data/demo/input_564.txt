We performed a search to identify available wearable sensors systems that can 
collect patient health data and have data sharing capabilities. Findings 
available in "Wearable sensors with possibilities for data exchange: Analyzing 
status and needs of different actors in mobile health monitoring systems" [1]. 
We performed an initial search of the Vandrico wearable database, and 
supplemented the resulting device list with an internet search. In addition to 
relevant meta-data (i.e. name, description, manufacturer, web-link, etc.) for 
each device, we also collected data on 13 attributes related to data exchange. 
I.e. device type, communication interface, data transfer protocol, smartphone 
and/or PC integration, direct integration to open health platform, 3rd platform 
integration with open health platform, support for health care system/middleware 
connection, recorded health data types, integrated sensors, medical device 
certification, whether or not the use can access collected data, device 
developer access, and device availability on the market. In addition, we grouped 
each device into three groups of actors that these devices are relevant for: 
electronic health record providers, software developers, and patients. The 
collected data can be used as an overview of available devices for future 
researchers with interest in the mobile health (mHealth) area.
