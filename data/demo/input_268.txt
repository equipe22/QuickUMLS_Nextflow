The creation of biological pathway knowledge bases is largely driven by manual 
effort to curate based on evidences from the scientific literature. It is highly 
challenging for the curators to keep up with the literature. Text mining 
applications have been developed in the last decade to assist human curators to 
speed up the curation pace where majority of them aim to identify the most 
relevant papers for curation with little attempt to directly extract the pathway 
information from text. In this paper, we describe a rule-based literature mining 
system to extract pathway information from text. We evaluated the system using 
curated pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) pathways in PharmGKB. The 
system achieved an F-measure of 63.11% and 34.99% for entity extraction and 
event extraction respectively against all PubMed abstracts cited in PharmGKB. It 
may be possible to improve the system performance by incorporating using 
statistical machine learning approaches. This study also helped us gain insights 
into the barriers towards automated event extraction from text for pathway 
curation.
