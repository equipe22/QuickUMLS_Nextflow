BACKGROUND: Term identification is the task of grounding ambiguous mentions of 
biomedical named entities in text to unique database identifiers. Previous work 
on term identification has focused on studying species-specific documents. 
However, full-length articles often describe entities across a number of 
species, in which case resolving the ambiguity of model organisms in entities is 
critical to achieving accurate term identification.
RESULTS: We developed and compared a number of rule-based and machine-learning 
based approaches to resolving species ambiguity in mentions of biomedical named 
entities, and demonstrated that a hybrid method achieved the best overall 
accuracy at 71.7%, as tested on the gold-standard ITI-TXM corpora. By utilising 
the species information predicted by the hybrid tagger, our rule-based term 
identification system was improved significantly by up to 11.6%.
CONCLUSION: This paper shows that, in the context of identifying terms involving 
multiple model organisms, integration of an accurate species disambiguation 
system can significantly improve the performance of term identification systems.
