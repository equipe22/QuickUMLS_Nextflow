"MonDossierMedical.ch" is a project led by the canton of Geneva, making it 
possible for every patient to access his own electronic health record (EHR) and 
to share the medical files with his doctors. It was introduced across the canton 
in mid-2013, and provided to all patients free of charge. it is based on the 
first Swiss-wide e-health-compliant pilot project "e-toile". The canton of 
Geneva developed "e-toile" as a public-private partnership together with Swiss 
Post and it was launched in 2009 in some of the canton's municipalities. Back 
then, Geneva's EHR represented the first Swiss attempt to link all healthcare 
professionals in the treatment chain. Today, it serves more than 4,600 patients 
and 380 physicians. This number is growing regularly, as well as the health care 
institutions (physicians, private hospitals, labs) joining the community. Added 
value tools, such as a shared care plan and a shared medication list will make 
the platform even more attractive.
