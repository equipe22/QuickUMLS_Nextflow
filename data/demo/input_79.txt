Clinical Trials (CTs) play an increasingly important role in modern medicine. 
Often these types of studies, especially in the final phases, require 
collaboration between several hospitals, laboratories and institutions in 
different places or countries. The solution proposed is a template which 
exploits the principles of Networked Clinical Research and the strengths of 
Clinical Data Management Systems (CDMSs) commonly used (Electronic Data Capture 
(EDC), Electronic Medical Record (EMR) and Electronic Health Record (EHR). 
Therefore, the basic structure is a highly normalized and standardized database 
which is managed by a web platform and, only by recording the required 
information and developing web pages starting from predefined templates, it is 
possible to carry out new projects. The result is a hybrid CDMS which preserves 
the flexibility and user autonomy of EDC systems; and contemporarily, permits 
the creation of patients cohorts, as in EMR and EHR systems, in which to realize 
simultaneously different multicentric CTs in several medical fields.
