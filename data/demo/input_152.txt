The volume of biomedical literature is increasing at such a rate that it is 
becoming difficult to locate, retrieve and manage the reported information 
without text mining, which aims to automatically distill information, extract 
facts, discover implicit links and generate hypotheses relevant to user needs. 
Ontologies, as conceptual models, provide the necessary framework for semantic 
representation of textual information. The principal link between text and an 
ontology is terminology, which maps terms to domain-specific concepts. This 
paper summarises different approaches in which ontologies have been used for 
text-mining applications in biomedicine.
