This paper describes a data-driven Decision Support System for 
Electroencephalography (EEG) signals acquisition, and parallel elaboration based 
on the integration of an Ambient Intelligent (AmI) [1] platform and a GRID 
enabled Infrastructure. The paper explores the analysis and design of the 
environment, the real-time data acquisition, the integration of the acquired 
data in dedicated EHR, and the EEG processing through parallel analysis 
algorithm available on the GRID infrastructure. After an overview of background 
concepts, the paper presents a brief description of the environment 
architecture, and a detailed analysis of the EEG algorithm. The challenge of the 
work presented is to effectively show how medical data can be shared and 
processed by exploiting the resources and capabilities of both the AmI platform 
and the GRID infrastructure. This particular Decision Support System, shows how 
it is possible to improve patient safety, quality of care, and efficiency in 
healthcare delivery.
