OBJECTIVE: To mine Twitter and quantitatively analyze COVID-19 symptoms 
self-reported by users, compare symptom distributions across studies, and create 
a symptom lexicon for future research.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrieved tweets using COVID-19-related keywords, and 
performed semiautomatic filtering to curate self-reports of positive-tested 
users. We extracted COVID-19-related symptoms mentioned by the users, mapped 
them to standard concept IDs in the Unified Medical Language System, and 
compared the distributions to those reported in early studies from clinical 
settings.
RESULTS: We identified 203 positive-tested users who reported 1002 symptoms 
using 668 unique expressions. The most frequently-reported symptoms were 
fever/pyrexia (66.1%), cough (57.9%), body ache/pain (42.7%), fatigue (42.1%), 
headache (37.4%), and dyspnea (36.3%) amongst users who reported at least 1 
symptom. Mild symptoms, such as anosmia (28.7%) and ageusia (28.1%), were 
frequently reported on Twitter, but not in clinical studies.
CONCLUSION: The spectrum of COVID-19 symptoms identified from Twitter may 
complement those identified in clinical settings.
