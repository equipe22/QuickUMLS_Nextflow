OBJECTIVE: Social media is becoming increasingly popular as a platform for 
sharing personal health-related information. This information can be utilized 
for public health monitoring tasks, particularly for pharmacovigilance, via the 
use of natural language processing (NLP) techniques. However, the language in 
social media is highly informal, and user-expressed medical concepts are often 
nontechnical, descriptive, and challenging to extract. There has been limited 
progress in addressing these challenges, and thus far, advanced machine 
learning-based NLP techniques have been underutilized. Our objective is to 
design a machine learning-based approach to extract mentions of adverse drug 
reactions (ADRs) from highly informal text in social media.
METHODS: We introduce ADRMine, a machine learning-based concept extraction 
system that uses conditional random fields (CRFs). ADRMine utilizes a variety of 
features, including a novel feature for modeling words' semantic similarities. 
The similarities are modeled by clustering words based on unsupervised, 
pretrained word representation vectors (embeddings) generated from unlabeled 
user posts in social media using a deep learning technique.
RESULTS: ADRMine outperforms several strong baseline systems in the ADR 
extraction task by achieving an F-measure of 0.82. Feature analysis demonstrates 
that the proposed word cluster features significantly improve extraction 
performance.
CONCLUSION: It is possible to extract complex medical concepts, with relatively 
high performance, from informal, user-generated content. Our approach is 
particularly scalable, suitable for social media mining, as it relies on large 
volumes of unlabeled data, thus diminishing the need for large, annotated 
training data sets.
