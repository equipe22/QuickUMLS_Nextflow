Knowledge of the interactions between drugs and transporters is important for 
drug discovery and development as well as for the evaluation of their clinical 
safety. We recently developed a text-mining system for the automatic extraction 
of information on chemical-CYP3A4 interactions from the literature. This system 
is based on natural language processing and can extract chemical names and their 
interaction patterns according to sentence context. The present study aimed to 
extend this system to the extraction of information regarding 
chemical-transporter interactions. For this purpose, the key verb list designed 
for cytochrome P450 enzymes was replaced with that for known drug transporters. 
The performance of the system was then tested by examining the accuracy of 
information on chemical-P-glycoprotein (P-gp) interactions extracted from 
randomly selected PubMed abstracts. The system achieved 89.8% recall and 84.2% 
precision for the identification of chemical names and 71.7% recall and 78.6% 
precision for the extraction of chemical-P-gp interactions.
