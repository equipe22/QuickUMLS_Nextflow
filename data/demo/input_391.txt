The paper describes how the PROMED platform can be used as a Electronic Patient 
Record (EHR) system and also the platform's contribution to the improvement of 
the healthcare services in Romania as a solution for the integration of the main 
stakeholders involved in a National Healthcare System: patients, health care 
providers and public health authorities. By using the PROMED platform, the 
Public Health Authorities will be able to view various reports about the 
population health status and can elaborate timely prevention and warning plans 
in case of epidemic diseases.
