The Electronic Health Record for Clinical Research (EHR4CR) project aims to 
improve the current process of clinical trials, providing a technological 
platform that supports the design and execution of trials. For the protocol 
feasibility scenario, the system currently allows the user to create a set of 
in-/exclusion criteria to find patients matching these criteria across sites 
located in several countries. The automated multi-country patient cohort system 
developed in EHR4CR implies substantial changes on the current protocol 
feasibility process, which will be reflected in this study.
