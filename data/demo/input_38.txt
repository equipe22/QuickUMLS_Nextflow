BACKGROUND: Biomedical event extraction is a crucial task in biomedical text 
mining. As the primary forum for international evaluation of different 
biomedical event extraction technologies, BioNLP Shared Task represents a trend 
in biomedical text mining toward fine-grained information extraction (IE). The 
fourth series of BioNLP Shared Task in 2016 (BioNLP-ST'16) proposed three tasks, 
in which the Bacteria Biotope event extraction (BB) task has been put forward in 
the earlier BioNLP-ST. Deep learning methods provide an effective way to 
automatically extract more complex features and achieve notable results in 
various natural language processing tasks.
RESULTS: The experimental results show that the presented approach can achieve 
an F-score of 57.42% in the test set, which outperforms previous 
state-of-the-art official submissions to BioNLP-ST 2016.
CONCLUSIONS: In this paper, we propose a novel Gated Recurrent Unit Networks 
framework integrating attention mechanism for extracting biomedical events 
between biotope and bacteria from biomedical literature, utilizing the corpus 
from the BioNLP'16 Shared Task on Bacteria Biotope task. The experimental 
results demonstrate the potential and effectiveness of the proposed framework.
