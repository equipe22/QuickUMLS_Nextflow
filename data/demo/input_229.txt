OBJECTIVE: To develop and evaluate a text mining system for extracting key 
clinical features from vaccine adverse event reporting system (VAERS) narratives 
to aid in the automated review of adverse event reports.
DESIGN: Based upon clinical significance to VAERS reviewing physicians, we 
defined the primary (diagnosis and cause of death) and secondary features (eg, 
symptoms) for extraction. We built a novel vaccine adverse event text mining 
(VaeTM) system based on a semantic text mining strategy. The performance of 
VaeTM was evaluated using a total of 300 VAERS reports in three sequential 
evaluations of 100 reports each. Moreover, we evaluated the VaeTM contribution 
to case classification; an information retrieval-based approach was used for the 
identification of anaphylaxis cases in a set of reports and was compared with 
two other methods: a dedicated text classifier and an online tool.
MEASUREMENTS: The performance metrics of VaeTM were text mining metrics: recall, 
precision and F-measure. We also conducted a qualitative difference analysis and 
calculated sensitivity and specificity for classification of anaphylaxis cases 
based on the above three approaches.
RESULTS: VaeTM performed best in extracting diagnosis, second level diagnosis, 
drug, vaccine, and lot number features (lenient F-measure in the third 
evaluation: 0.897, 0.817, 0.858, 0.874, and 0.914, respectively). In terms of 
case classification, high sensitivity was achieved (83.1%); this was equal and 
better compared to the text classifier (83.1%) and the online tool (40.7%), 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: Our VaeTM implementation of a semantic text mining strategy shows 
promise in providing accurate and efficient extraction of key features from 
VAERS narratives.
