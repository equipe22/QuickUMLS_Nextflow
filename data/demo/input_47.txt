BACKGROUND: Efficient generation of structured dose instructions that enable 
researchers to calculate drug exposure is central to pharmacoepidemiology 
studies. Our aim was to design and test an algorithm to codify dose 
instructions, applied to the NHS Scotland Prescribing Information System (PIS) 
that records about 100 million prescriptions per annum.
METHODS: A natural language processing (NLP) algorithm was developed that 
enabled free-text dose instructions to be represented by three 
attributes - quantity, frequency and qualifier - specified by three, three and 
two variables, respectively. A sample of 15 593 distinct dose instructions was 
used to test, validate and refine the algorithm. The final algorithm used a 
zero-assumption approach and was then applied to the full dataset.
RESULTS: The initial algorithm generated structured output for 13 152 (84.34%) 
of the 15 593 sample dose instructions, and reviewers identified 767 (5.83%) 
incorrect translations, giving an accuracy of 94.17%. Following subsequent 
refinement of the algorithm rules, application to the full dataset of 
458 227 687 prescriptions (99.67% had dose instructions represented by 4 964 083 
distinct instructions) generated a structured output for 92.3% of dose 
instruction texts. This varied by therapeutic area (from 86.7% for the central 
nervous system to 96.8% for the cardiovascular system).
CONCLUSIONS: We created an NLP algorithm, operational at scale, to produce 
structured output that gives data users maximum flexibility to formulate, test 
and apply their own assumptions according to the medicines under investigation. 
Text mining approaches can provide a solution to the safe and efficient 
management and provisioning of large volumes of data generated through our 
health systems.
