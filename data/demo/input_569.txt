OBJECTIVE: To determine if inclusion/exclusion (I/E) criteria of clinical trial 
protocols can be represented as structured queries and executed using a secure 
federated research platform (InSite) on hospital electronic health records (EHR) 
systems, to estimate the number of potentially eligible patients.
METHODS: Twenty-three clinical trial protocols completed during 2011-2017 across 
diverse disease areas were analyzed to construct queries that were executed with 
InSite using EHR records from 24 European hospitals containing records of >14 
million patients. The number of patients matching I/E criteria of each protocol 
was estimated.
RESULTS: All protocols could be formalized to some extent into a medical coding 
system (e.g. ICD-10CM, ATC, LOINC, SNOMED) and mapped to local hospital coding 
systems. The median number of I/E criteria of protocols tested was 29 (range: 
14-47). A median of 55% (range 38-89%) of I/E criteria in each protocol could be 
transformed into a computable format. The median number of eligible patients 
identified was 26 per hospital site (range: 1-134).
CONCLUSION: Clinical trial I/E eligibility criteria can be structured 
computationally and executed as queries on EHR systems to estimate the patient 
recruitment pool at each site. The results further suggest that an increase in 
structured coded information in EHRs would increase the number of I/E criteria 
that could be evaluated. Additional work is needed on broader deployment of 
federated platforms such as InSite.
