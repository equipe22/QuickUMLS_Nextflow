The purpose of this research is to answer the question, can medically-relevant 
terms be extracted from text notes and text mined for the purpose of 
classification and obtain equal or better results than text mining the original 
note? A novel method is used to extract medically-relevant terms for the purpose 
of text mining. A dataset of 5,009 EMR text notes (1,151 related to falls) was 
obtained from a Veterans Administration Medical Center. The dataset was 
processed with a natural language processing (NLP) application which extracted 
concepts based on SNOMED-CT terms from the Unified Medical Language System 
(UMLS) Metathesaurus. SAS Enterprise Miner was used to text mine both the set of 
complete text notes and the set represented by the extracted concepts. Logistic 
regression models were built from the results, with the extracted concept model 
performing slightly better than the complete note model.
