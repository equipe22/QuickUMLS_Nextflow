RATIONALE: The quality and patient-centeredness of intensive care unit 
(ICU)-based palliative care delivery is highly variable.
OBJECTIVE: To develop and pilot an app platform for clinicians and ICU patients 
and their family members that enhances the delivery of needs-targeted palliative 
care.
METHODS: In the development phase of the study, we developed an electronic 
health record (EHR) system-integrated mobile web app system prototype, PCplanner 
(Palliative Care Planner). PCplanner screens the EHR for ICU patients meeting 
any of five prompts (triggers) for palliative care consultation, allows families 
to report their unmet palliative care needs, and alerts clinicians to these 
needs. The evaluation phase included a prospective before/after study conducted 
at a large academic medical center. Two control populations were enrolled in the 
before period to serve as context for the intervention. First, 25 ICU patients 
who received palliative care consults served as patient-level controls. Second, 
49 family members of ICU patients who received mechanical ventilation for at 
least 48 hours served as family-level controls. Afterward, 14 patients, 18 
family members, and 10 clinicians participated in the intervention evaluation 
period. Family member outcomes measured at baseline and 4 days later included 
acceptability (Client Satisfaction Questionnaire [CSQ]), usability (Systems 
Usability Scale [SUS]), and palliative care needs, assessed with the adapted 
needs of social nature, existential concerns, symptoms, and therapeutic 
interaction (NEST) scale; the Patient-Centeredness of Care Scale (PCCS); and the 
Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Patient outcomes included frequency of goal 
concordant treatment, hospital length of stay, and discharge disposition.
RESULTS: Family members reported high PCplanner acceptability (mean CSQ, 14.1 
[SD, 1.4]) and usability (mean SUS, 21.1 [SD, 1.7]). PCplanner family member 
recipients experienced a 12.7-unit reduction in NEST score compared with a 
3.4-unit increase among controls (P = 0.002), as well as improved mean scores on 
the PCCS (6.6 [SD, 5.8]) and the PSS (-0.8 [SD, 1.9]). The frequency of 
goal-concordant treatment increased over the course of the intervention (n = 14 
[SD, 79%] vs. n = 18 [SD, 100%]). Compared with palliative care controls, 
intervention patients received palliative care consultation sooner (3.9 [SD, 
2.7] vs. 6.9 [SD, 7.1] mean days), had a shorter mean hospital length of stay 
(20.5 [SD, 9.1] vs. 22.3 [SD, 16.0] patient number), and received hospice care 
more frequently (5 [36%] vs. 5 [20%]), although these differences were not 
statistically significant.
CONCLUSIONS: PCplanner represents an acceptable, usable, and clinically 
promising systems-based approach to delivering EHR-triggered, needs-targeted 
ICU-based palliative care within a standard clinical workflow. A clinical trial 
in a larger population is needed to evaluate its efficacy.
