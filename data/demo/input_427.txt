As part of its mission to advance the technological capabilities of its 
products, Ovid introduced a redesign of its database platform in fall 2007. The 
platform redesign brought new features and enhancements to an already robust 
system. The transition between Ovid Gateway and the OvidSP platform was 
orchestrated seamlessly. With the OvidSP platform came innovative changes such 
as the incorporation of Natural Language Processing associated with the new 
Basic Search mode. Discussed are OvidSP features, advantages and disadvantages 
of the new platform, customizable settings, and future direction.
