A basic task in first language acquisition likely involves discovering the 
boundaries between words or morphemes in input where these basic units are not 
overtly segmented. A number of unsupervised learning algorithms have been 
proposed in the last 20 years for these purposes, some of which have been 
implemented computationally, but whose results remain difficult to compare 
across papers. We created a tool that is open source, enables reproducible 
results, and encourages cumulative science in this domain. WordSeg has a modular 
architecture: It combines a set of corpora description routines, multiple 
algorithms varying in complexity and cognitive assumptions (including several 
that were not publicly available, or insufficiently documented), and a rich 
evaluation package. In the paper, we illustrate the use of this package by 
analyzing a corpus of child-directed speech in various ways, which further 
allows us to make recommendations for experimental design of follow-up work. 
Supplementary materials allow readers to reproduce every result in this paper, 
and detailed online instructions further enable them to go beyond what we have 
done. Moreover, the system can be installed within container software that 
ensures a stable and reliable environment. Finally, by virtue of its modular 
architecture and transparency, WordSeg can work as an open-source platform, to 
which other researchers can add their own segmentation algorithms.
