OBJECTIVE: Secondary data are a significant resource for in-depth epidemiologic 
and public health research. It also allows for effective quality control and 
clinical outcomes measurement. To illustrate the value of structured diagnostic 
entry, a use case was developed to quantify adherence to current practice 
guidelines for managing chronic moderate periodontitis (CMP).
METHODS: Six dental schools using the same electronic health record (EHR) 
contribute data to a dental data repository (BigMouth) based on the i2b2 
data-warehousing platform. Participating institutions are able to query across 
the full repository without being able to back trace specific data to its 
originating institution. At each of the three sites whose data are included in 
this analysis, the Dental Diagnostic System (DDS) terminology was used to 
document diagnoses in the clinics. We ran multiple queries against this 
multi-institutional database, and the output was validated by manually reviewing 
a subset of patient charts.
RESULTS: Over the period under study, 1,866 patients were diagnosed with CMP. Of 
these, 15 percent received only periodontal prophylaxis treatment, 20 percent 
received only periodontal maintenance treatment, and only 41 percent received 
periodontal maintenance treatment in combination with other AAP guideline 
treatments.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that most patients with CMP were not treated 
according to the AAP guidelines. On the basis of this use case, we conclude that 
the availability and habitual use of a structured diagnosis in an EHR allow for 
the aggregation and secondary analyses of clinical data to support downstream 
analyses for quality improvement and epidemiological assessments.
