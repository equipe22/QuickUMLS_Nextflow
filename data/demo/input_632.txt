BACKGROUND: The emergence of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic in 
March 2020 created unprecedented challenges in the provision of scheduled 
ambulatory cancer care. As a result, there has been a renewed focus on 
video-based telehealth consultations as a means to continue ambulatory care.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to analyze the change in video visit volume 
at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Comprehensive Cancer 
Center in response to COVID-19 and compare patient demographics and appointment 
data from January 1, 2020, and in the 11 weeks after the transition to video 
visits.
METHODS: Patient demographics and appointment data (dates, visit types, and 
departments) were extracted from the electronic health record reporting 
database. Video visits were performed using a HIPAA (Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act)-compliant video conferencing platform with a 
pre-existing workflow.
RESULTS: In 17 departments and divisions at the UCSF Cancer Center, 2284 video 
visits were performed in the 11 weeks before COVID-19 changes were implemented 
(mean 208, SD 75 per week) and 12,946 video visits were performed in the 11-week 
post-COVID-19 period (mean 1177, SD 120 per week). The proportion of video 
visits increased from 7%-18% to 54%-72%, between the pre- and post-COVID-19 
periods without any disparity based on race/ethnicity, primary language, or 
payor.
CONCLUSIONS: In a remarkably brief period of time, we rapidly scaled the 
utilization of telehealth in response to COVID-19 and maintained access to 
complex oncologic care at a time of social distancing.
