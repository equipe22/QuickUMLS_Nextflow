Physicians often lack the time to familiarize themselves with the details of 
particular allergies or other drug restrictions. Clinical Decision Support 
(CDS), based on a structured terminology as SNOMED CT (SCT), can help physicians 
get an overview, by automatically alerting allergy, interactions and other 
important information. The centralized CDS platform based on SCT, controls 
Allergy, Interactions, Risk Situation Drugs and Max Dose restrictions by the 
help of databases developed for these specific purposes. The CDS will respond to 
automatic web service requests from the hospital or GP electronic medication 
system (EMS) during prescription, and return alerts and information. The CDS 
also contains a Physicians Preference Database where the physicians individually 
can set which kind of alerts they want to see. The result is clinically useful 
information physicians can use as a base for a more effective and safer 
treatment, without developing alert fatigue.
