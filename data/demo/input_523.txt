AIM: A feasibility study was conducted to evaluate implementation of a 
voice-enabled automated platform for collection of medical data from patients 
with cardiovascular disease: CardioCube.
METHODS: The study enrolled 22 individuals (10 males, 45.5%) including 9 
patients with cardiovascular disease and 13 healthy participants. Utilizing (1) 
voice-enabled patient registration software implemented on the Amazon Echo and 
(2) web-based electronic health record (EHR) system, study participants verbally 
answered a set of clinical questions. Primary endpoint: accuracy of ​the 
​CardioCube system. Secondary endpoints: acceptability, usability and technical 
performance. The study was performed at the Outpatient Cardiology Clinic, 
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, USA.
RESULTS: The CardioCube system collected 432 data points with a high agreement 
level between verbally provided data and corresponding EHR information (accuracy 
97.51%). The CardioCube was able to automatically generate a summarized medical 
report, which was instantly available for a doctor in the web-based EHR system. 
Patients reported CardioCube was "easy to use". Applicability of the system was 
graded excellent by the medical staff. A single session utilized less than 
0.002% of available computational resources.
CONCLUSION: CardioCube can collect, index and document medical data using a 
voice interface. In this pilot study, CardioCube supported healthcare 
professionals by performing time-consuming paperwork during patient 
registration.
