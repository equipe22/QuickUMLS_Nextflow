BACKGROUND: Social media platforms constitute a rich data source for natural 
language processing tasks such as named entity recognition, relation extraction, 
and sentiment analysis. In particular, social media platforms about health 
provide a different insight into patient's experiences with diseases and 
treatment than those found in the scientific literature.
OBJECTIVE: This paper aimed to report a study of entities related to chronic 
diseases and their relation in user-generated text posts. The major focus of our 
research is the study of biomedical entities found in health social media 
platforms and their relations and the way people suffering from chronic diseases 
express themselves.
METHODS: We collected a corpus of 17,624 text posts from disease-specific 
subreddits of the social news and discussion website Reddit. For entity and 
relation extraction from this corpus, we employed the PKDE4J tool developed by 
Song et al (2015). PKDE4J is a text mining system that integrates 
dictionary-based entity extraction and rule-based relation extraction in a 
highly flexible and extensible framework.
RESULTS: Using PKDE4J, we extracted 2 types of entities and relations: 
biomedical entities and relations and subject-predicate-object entity relations. 
In total, 82,138 entities and 30,341 relation pairs were extracted from the 
Reddit dataset. The most highly mentioned entities were those related to 
oncological disease (2884 occurrences of cancer) and asthma (2180 occurrences). 
The relation pair anatomy-disease was the most frequent (5550 occurrences), the 
highest frequent entities in this pair being cancer and lymph. The manual 
validation of the extracted entities showed a very good performance of the 
system at the entity extraction task (3682/5151, 71.48% extracted entities were 
correctly labeled).
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that people are eager to share their personal 
experience with chronic diseases on social media platforms despite possible 
privacy and security issues. The results reported in this paper are promising 
and demonstrate the need for more in-depth studies on the way patients with 
chronic diseases express themselves on social media platforms.
