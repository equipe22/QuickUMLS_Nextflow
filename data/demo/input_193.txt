Research into typing patterns has broad applications in both psycholinguistics 
and biometrics (i.e., improving security of computer access via each user's 
unique typing patterns). We present a new software package, TypingSuite, which 
can be used for presenting visual and auditory stimuli, collecting typing data, 
and summarizing and analyzing the data. TypingSuite is a Java-based software 
package that is platform-independent and open-source. To validate TypingSuite as 
a beneficial tool for researchers who are interested in keystroke dynamics, two 
studies were conducted. First, a behavioural experiment based on single word 
typing was conducted that replicated two well-known findings in typing research, 
namely the lexicality and frequency effects. The results confirmed that words 
are typed faster than pseudowords and that high frequency words are typed faster 
than low frequency words. Second, in regard to biometrics, it was also shown 
that typing data from the same user are more similar than data from different 
users. Because TypingSuite allows its users to easily implement an experiment 
and to collect and analyze data within a single software package, it holds 
promise for being a valuable educational and research tool in language-related 
sciences such as psycholinguistics and natural language processing.
