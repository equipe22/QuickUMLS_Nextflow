PURPOSE: Drug indications and disease symptoms often confound adverse event 
reports in real-world datasets, including electronic health records and reports 
in the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). A thorough, standardized set 
of indications and symptoms is needed to identify these confounders in such 
datasets for drug research and safety assessment. The aim of this study is to 
create a comprehensive list of drug-indication associations and disease-symptom 
associations using multiple resources, including existing databases and natural 
language processing.
METHODS: Drug indications for drugs approved in the USA were extracted from two 
databases, RxNorm and Side Effect Resource (SIDER). Symptoms for these 
indications were extracted from MedlinePlus and using natural language 
processing from PubMed abstracts.
RESULTS: A total of 1361 unique drugs, 1656 unique indications, and 2201 unique 
symptoms were extracted from a wide variety of MedDRA System Organ Classes. 
Text-mining precision was maximized at 0.65 by examining Term Frequency Inverse 
Document Frequency (TF-IDF) scores of the disease-symptom associations.
CONCLUSION: The drug-indication associations and disease-symptom associations 
collected in this study may be useful in identifying confounders in other 
datasets, such as safety reports. With further refinement and additional drugs, 
indications, and symptoms, this dataset may become a quality resource for 
disease symptoms.
