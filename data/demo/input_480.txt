OBJECTIVES: Electronic consultation, or e-consult, systems improve specialty 
care access by conveying specialist expertise to primary care clinicians (PCCs) 
without requiring specialist visits. Our study evaluates organizational factors 
for e-consult implementation across 5 publicly financed, county-based health 
systems in California. Each system serves 40,000 to 180,000 culturally and 
linguistically diverse patients across 4 to 19 primary care locations.
STUDY DESIGN: We interviewed leaders whose systems received grant funding 
between 2015 and 2017 to plan and implement e-consult. Interviews discussed 
platform selection, electronic health record (EHR) compatibility, PCC and 
specialist opinions, and project governance. We also collected implementing 
systems' platform operations metrics.
METHODS: Mixed methods, including semistructured interviews and quantitative 
platform metrics. Interviews were analyzed in alignment with the Consolidated 
Framework for Implementation Research inner setting domain.
RESULTS: Three of the 5 systems successfully implemented e-consults. System 1 
sustained implementation across 27 specialties, system 2 achieved fragmented 
implementation, and system 3 reported early-stage implementation. Existing 
PCC-specialist relationships emerged as the strongest facilitator. E-consult-EHR 
technology integration was also important, although an add-on platform enabled 
e-consult expansion in system 2. Although all systems faced challenges, such as 
project management resourcing, systems 4 and 5 abandoned implementation amid 
compound climate and readiness barriers.
CONCLUSIONS: Successful e-consult implementations in public delivery systems 
leveraged (1) prior primary care and specialty care clinician relationships and 
(2)Â integrated EHR and e-consult platforms. This contrasts with common 
expectations that new technology will overcome care delivery gaps. Findings add 
to existing e-consult implementation literature that emphasizes reimbursement 
and leadership champions.
