Compared with other psychiatric disorders of similar heritabilities, the 
progress of substance use disorders (SUD) genetics has been slow. With the 
growing availability of large-scale biobanks with extensive phenotypes from 
electronic health records (EHR) and genotypes across millions of individuals, 
this platform is the next tool to accelerate SUD genetics research.
