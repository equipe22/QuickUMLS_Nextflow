Third-party platforms have emerged to support small primary care practices for 
calculating and reporting electronic clinical quality measures (eCQM) for 
federal programs like The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 
(MACRA) and Merit-based Incentive Payment System (MIPS). Yet little is known 
about the capabilities and limitations of electronic health record systems 
(EHRs) to enable data access for these programs. We connected 116 small- to 
medium-sized practices with seven different EHRs to popHealth, an open-source 
eCQM platform. We identified the prevalence of following problems with eCQM data 
for data extraction in seven different EHRs: (1) Lack of coded data in five of 
seven; (2) Incorrectly categorized data in four of seven; (3) Isosemantic data 
(data within the incorrect context) in four of seven; (4) Coding that could not 
be directly evaluated in six of seven; (5) Errors in date assignment and labeled 
as historical values in five of seven; and (6) Inadequate data to assign the 
correct code in two of seven. We recommend specific enhancements to EHR systems 
that can promote effective eCQM implementation and reporting to MACRA and MIPS.
