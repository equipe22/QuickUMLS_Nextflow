The database of genotypes and phenotypes (dbGaP) developed by the National 
Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) is a resource that contains 
information on various genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and is currently 
available via NCBI's dbGaP Entrez interface. The database is an important 
resource, providing GWAS data that can be used for new exploratory research or 
cross-study validation by authorized users. However, finding studies relevant to 
a particular phenotype of interest is challenging, as phenotype information is 
presented in a non-standardized way. To address this issue, we developed 
PhenDisco (phenotype discoverer), a new information retrieval system for dbGaP. 
PhenDisco consists of two main components: (1) text processing tools that 
standardize phenotype variables and study metadata, and (2) information 
retrieval tools that support queries from users and return ranked results. In a 
preliminary comparison involving 18 search scenarios, PhenDisco showed promising 
performance for both unranked and ranked search comparisons with dbGaP's search 
engine Entrez. The system can be accessed at http://pfindr.net.
