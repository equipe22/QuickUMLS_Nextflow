BACKGROUND: Extraction of protein phosphorylation information from biomedical 
literature has gained much attention because of the importance in numerous 
biological processes.
OBJECTIVE: In this study, we propose a text mining methodology which consists of 
two phases, NLP parsing and SVM classification to extract phosphorylation 
information from literature.
METHODS: First, using NLP parsing we divide the data into three base-forms 
depending on the biomedical entities related to phosphorylation and further 
classify into ten sub-forms based on their distribution with phosphorylation 
keyword. Next, we extract the phosphorylation entity singles/pairs/triplets and 
apply SVM to classify the extracted singles/pairs/triplets using a set of 
features applicable to each sub-form.
RESULTS: The performance of our methodology was evaluated on three corpora 
namely PLC, iProLink and hPP corpus. We obtained promising results of >85% 
F-score on ten sub-forms of training datasets on cross validation test. Our 
system achieved overall F-score of 93.0% on iProLink and 96.3% on hPP corpus 
test datasets. Furthermore, our proposed system achieved best performance on 
cross corpus evaluation and outperformed the existing system with recall of 
90.1%.
CONCLUSIONS: The performance analysis of our unique system on three corpora 
reveals that it extracts protein phosphorylation information efficiently in both 
non-organism specific general datasets such as PLC and iProLink, and human 
specific dataset such as hPP corpus.
