BACKGROUND: The first Multi-center Medication Reconciliation Quality Improvement 
Study (MARQUIS1) demonstrated that implementation of a medication reconciliation 
best practices toolkit decreased total unintentional medication discrepancies in 
five hospitals. We sought to implement the MARQUIS toolkit in more diverse 
hospitals, incorporating lessons learned from MARQUIS1.
METHODS: MARQUIS2 is a pragmatic, mentored implementation QI study which 
collected clinical and implementation outcomes. Sites implemented a revised 
toolkit, which included interventions from these domains: 1) best possible 
medication history (BPMH)-taking; 2) discharge medication reconciliation and 
patient/caregiver counseling; 3) identifying and defining clinician roles and 
responsibilities; 4) risk stratification; 5) health information technology 
improvements; 6) improved access to medication sources; 7) identification and 
correction of real-time discrepancies; and, 8) stakeholder engagement. Eight 
hospitalists mentored the sites via one site visit and monthly phone calls over 
the 18-month intervention period. Each site's local QI team assessed 
opportunities to improve, implemented at least one of the 17 toolkit components, 
and accessed a variety of resources (e.g. implementation manual, webinars, and 
workshops). Outcomes to be assessed will include unintentional medication 
discrepancies per patient.
DISCUSSION: A mentored multi-center medication reconciliation QI initiative 
using a best practices toolkit was successfully implemented across 18 medical 
centers. The 18 participating sites varied in size, teaching status, location, 
and electronic health record (EHR) platform. We introduce barriers to 
implementation and lessons learned from MARQUIS1, such as the importance of 
utilizing dedicated, trained medication history takers, simple EHR solutions, 
clarifying roles and responsibilities, and the input of patients and families 
when improving medication reconciliation.
