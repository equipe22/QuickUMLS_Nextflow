OBJECTIVES: This research presents the design and development of a software 
architecture using natural language processing tools and the use of an ontology 
of knowledge as a knowledge base.
METHODS: The software extracts, manages and represents the knowledge of a text 
in natural language. A corpus of more than 200 medical domain documents from the 
general medicine and palliative care areas was validated, demonstrating relevant 
knowledge elements for physicians.
RESULTS: Indicators for precision, recall and F-measure were applied. An 
ontology was created called the knowledge elements of the medical domain to 
manipulate patient information, which can be read or accessed from any other 
software platform.
CONCLUSIONS: The developed software architecture extracts the medical knowledge 
of the clinical histories of patients from two different corpora. The 
architecture was validated using the metrics of information extraction systems.
