BACKGROUND: The population-based assessment of patient-centered outcomes (PCOs) 
has been limited by the efficient and accurate collection of these data. Natural 
language processing (NLP) pipelines can determine whether a clinical note within 
an electronic medical record contains evidence on these data. We present and 
demonstrate the accuracy of an NLP pipeline that targets to assess the presence, 
absence, or risk discussion of two important PCOs following prostate cancer 
treatment: urinary incontinence (UI) and bowel dysfunction (BD).
METHODS: We propose a weakly supervised NLP approach which annotates electronic 
medical record clinical notes without requiring manual chart review. A weighted 
function of neural word embedding was used to create a sentence-level vector 
representation of relevant expressions extracted from the clinical notes. 
Sentence vectors were used as input for a multinomial logistic model, with 
output being either presence, absence or risk discussion of UI/BD. The 
classifier was trained based on automated sentence annotation depending only on 
domain-specific dictionaries (weak supervision).
RESULTS: The model achieved an average F1 score of 0.86 for the sentence-level, 
three-tier classification task (presence/absence/risk) in both UI and BD. The 
model also outperformed a pre-existing rule-based model for note-level 
annotation of UI with significant margin.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate a machine learning method to categorize clinical 
notes based on important PCOs that trains a classifier on sentence vector 
representations labeled with a domain-specific dictionary, which eliminates the 
need for manual engineering of linguistic rules or manual chart review for 
extracting the PCOs. The weakly supervised NLP pipeline showed promising 
sensitivity and specificity for identifying important PCOs in unstructured 
clinical text notes compared to rule-based algorithms.
