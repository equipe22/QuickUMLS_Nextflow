Culturing microorganisms is a critical step in understanding and utilizing 
microbial life. Here we map the landscape of existing culture media by 
extracting natural-language media recipes into a Known Media Database (KOMODO), 
which includes >18,000 strain-media combinations, >3300 media variants and 
compound concentrations (the entire collection of the Leibniz Institute DSMZ 
repository). Using KOMODO, we show that although media are usually tuned for 
individual strains using biologically common salts, trace metals and 
vitamins/cofactors are the most differentiating components between defined media 
of strains within a genus. We leverage KOMODO to predict new organism-media 
pairings using a transitivity property (74% growth in new in vitro experiments) 
and a phylogeny-based collaborative filtering tool (83% growth in new in vitro 
experiments and stronger growth on predicted well-scored versus poorly scored 
media). These resources are integrated into a web-based platform that predicts 
media given an organism's 16S rDNA sequence, facilitating future cultivation 
efforts.
