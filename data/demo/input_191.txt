OBJECTIVE: The ability of a cue-based system to accurately assert whether a 
disorder is affirmed, negated, or uncertain is dependent, in part, on its cue 
lexicon. In this paper, we continue our study of porting an assertion system 
(pyConTextNLP) from English to Swedish (pyConTextSwe) by creating an optimized 
assertion lexicon for clinical Swedish.
METHODS AND MATERIAL: We integrated cues from four external lexicons, along with 
generated inflections and combinations. We used subsets of a clinical corpus in 
Swedish. We applied four assertion classes (definite existence, probable 
existence, probable negated existence and definite negated existence) and two 
binary classes (existence yes/no and uncertainty yes/no) to pyConTextSwe. We 
compared pyConTextSwe's performance with and without the added cues on a 
development set, and improved the lexicon further after an error analysis. On a 
separate evaluation set, we calculated the system's final performance.
RESULTS: Following integration steps, we added 454 cues to pyConTextSwe. The 
optimized lexicon developed after an error analysis resulted in statistically 
significant improvements on the development set (83% F-score, overall). The 
system's final F-scores on an evaluation set were 81% (overall). For the 
individual assertion classes, F-score results were 88% (definite existence), 81% 
(probable existence), 55% (probable negated existence), and 63% (definite 
negated existence). For the binary classifications existence yes/no and 
uncertainty yes/no, final system performance was 97%/87% and 78%/86% F-score, 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: We have successfully ported pyConTextNLP to Swedish (pyConTextSwe). 
We have created an extensive and useful assertion lexicon for Swedish clinical 
text, which could form a valuable resource for similar studies, and which is 
publicly available.
