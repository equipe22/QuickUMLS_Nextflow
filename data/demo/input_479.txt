Accurate and computationally efficient approaches in discovering relationships 
between biological objects from text documents are important for biologists to 
develop biological models. This paper presents a novel approach to extract 
relationships between multiple biological objects that are present in a text 
document. The approach involves object identification, reference resolution, 
ontology and synonym discovery, and extracting object-object relationships. 
Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), dictionaries, and N-Gram models are used to set the 
framework to tackle the complex task of extracting object-object relationships. 
Experiments were carried out using a corpus of one thousand Medline abstracts. 
Intermediate results were obtained for the object identification process, 
synonym discovery, and finally the relationship extraction. For a corpus of 
thousand abstracts, 53 relationships were extracted of which 43 were correct, 
giving a specificity of 81%. The approach is both adaptable and scalable to new 
problems as opposed to rule-based methods.
