Nephrology registry gives specialty control of quality data.

Weinstein A, Beckrich A, Singer D.

It is important for providers and practices to begin working with registry level 
data. Submitting data to a qualified clinical data registry currently satisfies 
Meaningful Use Stage II menu set items. In the future, with the rollout of MIPS 
and the increasing focus on sharing risk, registry data will be used as a 
benchmark for both publicly-reported performance (the physician compare program 
will be linked to provider-level QCDR data) and modifications to reimbursement. 
It is important to remember that PQRS data is the basis for the value based 
modifier now and MIPS- related quality data after 2018. The RPA has launched and 
is evolving a unique and versatile nephrology-specific data collection and 
analytics tool. In collaboration with the American Society of Diagnostic and 
Interventional Nephrology, vascular access measures will be added to the 
registry for 2016. The registry and the analytics platform is a tier of software 
operating above your practice management system and EHR and, if data can be 
obtained, it can span all the locations in which nephrologists provide care.
