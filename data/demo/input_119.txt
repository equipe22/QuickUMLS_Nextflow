BACKGROUND: The primary method for scientific communication is in the form of 
published scientific articles and theses which use natural language combined 
with domain-specific terminology. As such, they contain free owing unstructured 
text. Given the usefulness of data extraction from unstructured literature, we 
aim to show how this can be achieved for the discipline of chemistry. The highly 
formulaic style of writing most chemists adopt make their contributions well 
suited to high-throughput Natural Language Processing (NLP) approaches.
RESULTS: We have developed the ChemicalTagger parser as a medium-depth, 
phrase-based semantic NLP tool for the language of chemical experiments. Tagging 
is based on a modular architecture and uses a combination of OSCAR, 
domain-specific regex and English taggers to identify parts-of-speech. The ANTLR 
grammar is used to structure this into tree-based phrases. Using a metric that 
allows for overlapping annotations, we achieved machine-annotator agreements of 
88.9% for phrase recognition and 91.9% for phrase-type identification (Action 
names).
CONCLUSIONS: It is possible parse to chemical experimental text using rule-based 
techniques in conjunction with a formal grammar parser. ChemicalTagger has been 
deployed for over 10,000 patents and has identified solvents from their 
linguistic context with >99.5% precision.
