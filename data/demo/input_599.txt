Use of deceased subject Electronic Health Records can be an important piloting 
platform for informatics or biomedical research. Existing legal framework allows 
such research under less strict de-identification criteria; however, privacy of 
non-decedent must be protected. We report on creation of the decease subject 
Integrated Data Repository (dsIDR) at National Institutes of Health, Clinical 
Center and a pilot methodology to remove secondary protected health information 
or identifiable information (secondary PxI; information about persons other than 
the primary patient). We characterize available structured coded data in dsIDR 
and report the estimated frequencies of secondary PxI, ranging from 12.9% 
(sensitive token presence) to 1.1% (using stricter criteria). Federating 
decedent EHR data from multiple institutions can address sample size limitations 
and our pilot study provides lessons learned and methodology that can be adopted 
by other institutions.
