Chronic diseases like Heart Failure are widespread in the ageing population. 
Affected patients can be treated with the aid of a disease management program, 
including a telemedical collaborative network. Evaluation of a currently used 
system has shown that the information of the textual communication is of pivotal 
importance for the collaboration in the network. Thus, the challenge is to make 
this unstructured information useable, potentially leading to a better 
understanding of the collaboration so as to optimize the processes. This paper 
presents the setup of an analysis pipeline for processing textual information 
automatically, and, how this pipeline can be utilized to train a model that is 
able to automatically classify the written messages into a set of meaningful 
task and status categories.
