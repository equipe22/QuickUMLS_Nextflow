Heart Failure is a severe chronic disease of the heart. Telehealth networks 
implement closed-loop healthcare paradigms for optimal treatment of the 
patients. For comprehensive documentation of medication treatment, health 
professionals create free text collaboration notes in addition to structured 
information. To make this valuable source of information available for adherence 
analyses, we developed classifiers for automated categorization of notes based 
on natural language processing, which allows filtering of relevant entries to 
spare data analysts from tedious manual screening. Furthermore, we identified 
potential improvements of the queries for structured treatment documentation. 
For 3,952 notes, the majority of the manually annotated category tags was 
medication-related. The highest F1-measure of our developed classifiers was 
0.90. We conclude that our approach is a valuable tool to support adherence 
research based on datasets containing free-text entries.
