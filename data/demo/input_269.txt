OBJECTIVE: To reliably extract two entity types, symptoms and conditions (SCs), 
and drugs and treatments (DTs), from patient-authored text (PAT) by learning 
lexico-syntactic patterns from data annotated with seed dictionaries.
BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE: Despite the increasing quantity of PAT (eg, online 
discussion threads), tools for identifying medical entities in PAT are limited. 
When applied to PAT, existing tools either fail to identify specific entity 
types or perform poorly. Identification of SC and DT terms in PAT would enable 
exploration of efficacy and side effects for not only pharmaceutical drugs, but 
also for home remedies and components of daily care.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We use SC and DT term dictionaries compiled from online 
sources to label several discussion forums from MedHelp 
(http://www.medhelp.org). We then iteratively induce lexico-syntactic patterns 
corresponding strongly to each entity type to extract new SC and DT terms.
RESULTS: Our system is able to extract symptom descriptions and treatments 
absent from our original dictionaries, such as 'LADA', 'stabbing pain', and 
'cinnamon pills'. Our system extracts DT terms with 58-70% F1 score and SC terms 
with 66-76% F1 score on two forums from MedHelp. We show improvements over 
MetaMap, OBA, a conditional random field-based classifier, and a previous 
pattern learning approach.
CONCLUSIONS: Our entity extractor based on lexico-syntactic patterns is a 
successful and preferable technique for identifying specific entity types in 
PAT. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to extract SC and DT 
entities from PAT. We exhibit learning of informal terms often used in PAT but 
missing from typical dictionaries.
