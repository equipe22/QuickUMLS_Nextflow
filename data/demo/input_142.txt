There is currently a crisis in science related to highly publicized failures to 
reproduce large numbers of published studies. The current work proposes, by way 
of case studies, a methodology for moving the study of reproducibility in 
computational work to a full stage beyond that of earlier work. Specifically, it 
presents a case study in attempting to reproduce the reports of two R libraries 
for doing text mining of the PubMed/MEDLINE repository of scientific 
publications. The main findings are that a rational paradigm for reproduction of 
natural language processing papers can be established; the advertised 
functionality was difficult, but not impossible, to reproduce; and 
reproducibility studies can produce additional insights into the functioning of 
the published system. Additionally, the work on reproducibility lead to the 
production of novel user-centered documentation that has been accessed 260 times 
since its publication-an average of once a day per library.
