Natural language processing (NLP) technology can be used to rapidly extract 
protein-protein interactions from large collections of published literature. In 
this chapter we will work through a case study using MEDLINE biomedical 
abstracts (1) to find how a specific set of 50 genes interact with each other. 
We will show what steps are required to achieve this using the I2E software from 
Linguamatics ( www.linguamatics.com (2)).To extract protein networks from the 
literature, there are two typical strategies. The first is to find pairs of 
proteins which are mentioned together in the same context, for example, the same 
sentence, with the assumption that textual proximity implies biological 
association. The second approach is to use precise linguistic patterns based on 
NLP to find specific relationships between proteins. This can reveal the 
direction of the relationship and its nature such as "phosphorylation" or 
"upregulation". The I2E system uses a flexible text-mining approach, supporting 
both of these strategies, as well as hybrid strategies which fall between the 
two. In this chapter we show how multiple strategies can be combined to obtain 
high-quality results.
