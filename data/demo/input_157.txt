It is widely acknowledged that information extraction of unstructured clinical 
notes using natural language processing (NLP) and text mining is essential for 
secondary use of clinical data for clinical research and practice. Lab test 
results are currently structured in most of the electronic health record (EHR) 
systems. However, for referral patients or lab tests that can be done in 
non-clinical setting, the results can be captured in unstructured clinical 
notes. In this study, we proposed a rule-based information extraction system to 
extract the lab test results with temporal information from clinical notes. The 
lab test results of glucose and HbA1c from 104 randomly sampled diabetes 
patients selected from 1996 to 2015 are extracted and further correlated with 
structured lab test information in the Mayo Clinic EHRs. The system has high 
F1-scores of 0.964, 0.967 and 0.966 in glucose, HbA1c and overall extraction, 
respectively.
