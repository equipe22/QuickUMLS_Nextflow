Understanding temporal dynamics of COVID-19 symptoms could provide fine-grained 
resolution to guide clinical decision-making. Here, we use deep neural networks 
over an institution-wide platform for the augmented curation of clinical notes 
from 77,167 patients subjected to COVID-19 PCR testing. By contrasting 
Electronic Health Record (EHR)-derived symptoms of COVID-19-positive (COVIDpos; 
n = 2,317) versus COVID-19-negative (COVIDneg; n = 74,850) patients for the week 
preceding the PCR testing date, we identify anosmia/dysgeusia (27.1-fold), 
fever/chills (2.6-fold), respiratory difficulty (2.2-fold), cough (2.2-fold), 
myalgia/arthralgia (2-fold), and diarrhea (1.4-fold) as significantly amplified 
in COVIDpos over COVIDneg patients. The combination of cough and fever/chills 
has 4.2-fold amplification in COVIDpos patients during the week prior to PCR 
testing, in addition to anosmia/dysgeusia, constitutes the earliest EHR-derived 
signature of COVID-19. This study introduces an Augmented Intelligence platform 
for the real-time synthesis of institutional biomedical knowledge. The platform 
holds tremendous potential for scaling up curation throughput, thus enabling 
EHR-powered early disease diagnosis.
