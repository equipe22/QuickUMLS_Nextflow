Sophisticated information technologies are needed for effective data acquisition 
and integration from a growing body of the biomedical literature. Successful 
term identification is key to getting access to the stored literature 
information, as it is the terms (and their relationships) that convey knowledge 
across scientific articles. Due to the complexities of a dynamically changing 
biomedical terminology, term identification has been recognized as the current 
bottleneck in text mining, and--as a consequence--has become an important 
research topic both in natural language processing and biomedical communities. 
This article overviews state-of-the-art approaches in term identification. The 
process of identifying terms is analysed through three steps: term recognition, 
term classification, and term mapping. For each step, main approaches and 
general trends, along with the major problems, are discussed. By assessing 
previous work in context of the overall term identification process, the review 
also tries to delineate needs for future work in the field.
