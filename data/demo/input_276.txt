This paper presents a natural language processing (NLP) system that was designed 
to participate in the 2014 i2b2 de-identification challenge. The challenge task 
aims to identify and classify seven main Protected Health Information (PHI) 
categories and 25 associated sub-categories. A hybrid model was proposed which 
combines machine learning techniques with keyword-based and rule-based 
approaches to deal with the complexity inherent in PHI categories. Our proposed 
approaches exploit a rich set of linguistic features, both syntactic and word 
surface-oriented, which are further enriched by task-specific features and 
regular expression template patterns to characterize the semantics of various 
PHI categories. Our system achieved promising accuracy on the challenge test 
data with an overall micro-averaged F-measure of 93.6%, which was the winner of 
this de-identification challenge.
