BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Machine learning techniques for the text mining of 
cancer-related clinical documents have not been sufficiently explored. Here some 
techniques are presented for the pre-processing of free-text breast cancer 
pathology reports, with the aim of facilitating the extraction of information 
relevant to cancer staging.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The first technique was implemented using the freely 
available software RapidMiner to classify the reports according to their general 
layout: 'semi-structured' and 'unstructured'. The second technique was developed 
using the open source language engineering framework GATE and aimed at the 
prediction of chunks of the report text containing information pertaining to the 
cancer morphology, the tumour size, its hormone receptor status and the number 
of positive nodes. The classifiers were trained and tested respectively on sets 
of 635 and 163 manually classified or annotated reports, from the Northern 
Ireland Cancer Registry.
RESULTS: The best result of 99.4% accuracy - which included only one 
semi-structured report predicted as unstructured - was produced by the layout 
classifier with the k nearest algorithm, using the binary term occurrence word 
vector type with stopword filter and pruning. For chunk recognition, the best 
results were found using the PAUM algorithm with the same parameters for all 
cases, except for the prediction of chunks containing cancer morphology. For 
semi-structured reports the performance ranged from 0.97 to 0.94 and from 0.92 
to 0.83 in precision and recall, while for unstructured reports performance 
ranged from 0.91 to 0.64 and from 0.68 to 0.41 in precision and recall. Poor 
results were found when the classifier was trained on semi-structured reports 
but tested on unstructured.
CONCLUSIONS: These results show that it is possible and beneficial to predict 
the layout of reports and that the accuracy of prediction of which segments of a 
report may contain certain information is sensitive to the report layout and the 
type of information sought.
