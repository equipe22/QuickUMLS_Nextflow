MOTIVATION: In addition to existing bioinformatics software, a lot of new tools 
are being developed world wide to supply services for an ever growing, widely 
dispersed and heterogeneous collection of biological data. The integration of 
these resources under a common platform is a challenging task. To this end, 
several groups are developing integration technologies, in which services are 
usually registered in some sort of catalogue to allow novel discovering and 
accessing mechanisms to be implemented. However, each service demands specific 
interfaces to accommodate their parameters and it is a complicated task linking 
the different service inputs and outputs to solve a biological problem.
RESULTS: In this work we address the design and implementation of a versatile 
web client to access BioMOBY compatible services (a system by which a client can 
interact with multiple sources of biological data regardless of the underlying 
format or schema) using the service description stored in the BioMOBY catalogue. 
The automatic interface generator significantly reduces developing time and 
produces uniform service access mechanisms. The design and proof of concept (for 
such a client) including the generic interface generator have been developed and 
implemented in the National Institute for Bioinformatics in Spain.
