BACKGROUND: Surveillance for surgical site infections (SSIs) after ambulatory 
surgery in children requires a detailed manual chart review to assess criteria 
defined by the National Health and Safety Network (NHSN). Electronic health 
records (EHRs) impose an inefficient search process where infection 
preventionists must manually review every postsurgical encounter (< 30 days). 
Using text mining and business intelligence software, we developed an 
information foraging application, the SSI Workbench, to visually present which 
postsurgical encounters included SSI-related terms and synonyms, antibiotic, and 
culture orders.
OBJECTIVE: This article compares the Workbench and EHR on four dimensions: (1) 
effectiveness, (2) efficiency, (3) workload, and (4) usability.
METHODS: Comparative usability test of Workbench and EHR. Objective test metrics 
are time per case, encounters reviewed per case, time per encounter, and 
retrieval of information meeting NHSN definitions. Subjective measures are 
cognitive load using the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) 
Task Load Index (NASA TLX), and a questionnaire on system usability and utility.
RESULTS: Eight infection preventionists participated in the test. There was no 
difference in effectiveness as subjects retrieved information from all cases, 
using both systems, to meet the NHSN criteria. There was no difference in 
efficiency in time per case between the Workbench and EHR (8.58 vs. 7.39 
minutes, p = 0.36). However, with the Workbench subjects opened fewer encounters 
per case (3.0 vs. 7.5, p = 0.002), spent more time per encounter (2.23 vs. 0.92 
minutes, p = 0.002), rated the Workbench lower in cognitive load (NASA TLX, 24 
vs. 33, p = 0.02), and significantly higher in measures of usability.
CONCLUSION: Compared with the EHR, the Workbench was more usable, short, and 
reduced cognitive load. In overall efficiency, the Workbench did not save time, 
but demonstrated a shift from between-encounter foraging to within-encounter 
foraging and was rated as significantly more efficient. Our results suggest that 
infection surveillance can be better supported by systems applying information 
foraging theory.
