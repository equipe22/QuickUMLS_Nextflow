BACKGROUND: Studying comorbidities of disorders is important for detection and 
prevention. For discovering frequent patterns of diseases we can use 
retrospective analysis of population data, by filtering events with common 
properties and similar significance. Most frequent pattern mining methods do not 
consider contextual information about extracted patterns. Further data mining 
developments might enable more efficient applications in specific tasks like 
comorbidities identification.
METHODS: We propose a cascade data mining approach for frequent pattern mining 
enriched with context information, including a new algorithm MIxCO for maximal 
frequent patterns mining. Text mining tools extract entities from free text and 
deliver additional context attributes beyond the structured information about 
the patients.
RESULTS: The proposed approach was tested using pseudonymised reimbursement 
requests (outpatient records) submitted to the Bulgarian National Health 
Insurance Fund in 2010-2016 for more than 5 million citizens yearly. Experiments 
were run on 3 data collections. Some known comorbidities of Schizophrenia, 
Hyperprolactinemia and Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 are confirmed; novel hypotheses 
about stable comorbidities are generated. The evaluation shows that MIxCO is 
efficient for big dense datasets.
CONCLUSION: Explicating maximal frequent itemsets enables to build hypotheses 
concerning the relationships between the exogeneous and endogeneous factors 
triggering the formation of these sets. MixCO will help to identify risk groups 
of patients with a predisposition to develop socially-significant disorders like 
diabetes. This will turn static archives like the Diabetes Register in Bulgaria 
to a powerful alerting and predictive framework.
