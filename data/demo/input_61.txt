OBJECTIVE: To systematically examine clinical workflows before and after a major 
electronic health record (EHR) implementation, we performed this study. EHR 
implementation and/or conversion are associated with many challenges, which are 
barriers to optimal care. Clinical workflows may be significantly affected by 
EHR implementations and conversions, resulting in provider frustration and 
reduced efficiency.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Our institution completed a large EHR conversion and 
workflow standardization converting from 3 EHRs (GE Centricity and 2 versions of 
Cerner) to a system-wide Epic platform. To study this quantitatively and 
qualitatively, we collected and curated clinical workflows through rapid 
ethnography, workflow observation, video ethnography, and log-file analyses of 
hundreds of providers, patients, and more than 100,000 log files. The study 
included 5 geographic sites in 4 states (Arizona, Minnesota, Florida, and 
Wisconsin). This project began in April 2016, and will be completed by December 
2019. Our study began on May 1, 2016, and is ongoing.
RESULTS: Salient themes include the importance of prioritizing clinical areas 
with the most intensive EHR use, the value of tools to identify bottlenecks in 
workflow that cause delays, and desire for additional training to optimize 
navigation. Video microanalyses identified marked differences in patterns of 
workflow and EHR navigation patterns across sites. Log-file analyses and social 
network analyses identified differences in personnel roles, which led to 
differences in patient-clinician interaction, time spent using the EHR, and 
paper-based artifacts.
CONCLUSION: Assessing and curating workflow data before and after EHR conversion 
may provide opportunities for unexpected efficiencies in workflow optimization 
and information-system redesign. This project may be a model for capturing 
significant new knowledge in using EHRs to improve patient care, workflow 
efficiency, and outcomes.
