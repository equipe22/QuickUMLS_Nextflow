Despite the widespread use of the "Informatics for Integrating Biology and the 
Bedside" (i2b2) platform, there are substantial challenges for loading 
electronic health records (EHR) into i2b2 and for querying i2b2. We have 
previously presented a simplified framework for semantic abstraction of EHR 
records into i2b2. Building on our previous work, we have created a 
proof-of-concept implementation of cloud services on an i2b2 data store for 
cohort identification. Specifically, we have implemented a graphical user 
interface (GUI) that declares the key components for data import, 
transformation, and query of EHR data. The GUI integrates with Azure cloud 
services to create data pipelines for importing EHR data into i2b2, creation of 
derived facts, and querying for generating Sankey-like flow diagrams that 
characterize the patient cohorts. We have evaluated the implementation using the 
real-world MIMIC-III dataset. We discuss the key features of this implementation 
and direction for future work, which will advance the efforts of the research 
community for patient cohort identification.
