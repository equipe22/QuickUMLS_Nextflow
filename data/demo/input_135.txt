BACKGROUND: Interrogation of the electronic health record (EHR) using billing 
codes as a surrogate for diagnoses of interest has been widely used for clinical 
research. However, the accuracy of this methodology is variable, as it reflects 
billing codes rather than severity of disease, and depends on the disease and 
the accuracy of the coding practitioner. Systematic application of text mining 
to the EHR has had variable success for the detection of cardiovascular 
phenotypes. We hypothesize that the application of text mining algorithms to 
cardiovascular procedure reports may be a superior method to identify patients 
with cardiovascular conditions of interest.
METHODS: We adapted the Oracle product Endeca, which utilizes text mining to 
identify terms of interest from a NoSQL-like database, for purposes of searching 
cardiovascular procedure reports and termed the tool "PennSeek". We imported 
282,569 echocardiography reports representing 81,164 individuals and 27,205 
cardiac catheterization reports representing 14,567 individuals from 
non-searchable databases into PennSeek. We then applied clinical criteria to 
these reports in PennSeek to identify patients with trileaflet aortic stenosis 
(TAS) and coronary artery disease (CAD). Accuracy of patient identification by 
text mining through PennSeek was compared with ICD-9 billing codes.
RESULTS: Text mining identified 7115 patients with TAS and 9247 patients with 
CAD. ICD-9 codes identified 8272 patients with TAS and 6913 patients with CAD. 
4346 patients with AS and 6024 patients with CAD were identified by both 
approaches. A randomly selected sample of 200-250 patients uniquely identified 
by text mining was compared with 200-250 patients uniquely identified by billing 
codes for both diseases. We demonstrate that text mining was superior, with a 
positive predictive value (PPV) of 0.95 compared to 0.53 by ICD-9 for TAS, and a 
PPV of 0.97 compared to 0.86 for CAD.
CONCLUSION: These results highlight the superiority of text mining algorithms 
applied to electronic cardiovascular procedure reports in the identification of 
phenotypes of interest for cardiovascular research.
