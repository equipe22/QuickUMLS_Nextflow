OBJECTIVE: Electronic health records (EHRs) are a rich source of information on 
human diseases, but the information is variably structured, fragmented, curated 
using different coding systems, and collected for purposes other than medical 
research. We describe an approach for developing, validating, and sharing 
reproducible phenotypes from national structured EHR in the United Kingdom with 
applications for translational research.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We implemented a rule-based phenotyping framework, with 
up to 6 approaches of validation. We applied our framework to a sample of 15 
million individuals in a national EHR data source (population-based primary 
care, all ages) linked to hospitalization and death records in England. Data 
comprised continuous measurements (for example, blood pressure; medication 
information; coded diagnoses, symptoms, procedures, and referrals), recorded 
using 5 controlled clinical terminologies: (1) read (primary care, subset of 
SNOMED-CT [Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms]), (2) 
International Classification of Diseases-Ninth Revision and Tenth Revision 
(secondary care diagnoses and cause of mortality), (3) Office of Population 
Censuses and Surveys Classification of Surgical Operations and Procedures, 
Fourth Revision (hospital surgical procedures), and (4) DM+D prescription codes.
RESULTS: Using the CALIBER phenotyping framework, we created algorithms for 51 
diseases, syndromes, biomarkers, and lifestyle risk factors and provide up to 6 
validation approaches. The EHR phenotypes are curated in the open-access CALIBER 
Portal (https://www.caliberresearch.org/portal) and have been used by 40 
national and international research groups in 60 peer-reviewed publications.
CONCLUSIONS: We describe a UK EHR phenomics approach within the CALIBER EHR data 
platform with initial evidence of validity and use, as an important step toward 
international use of UK EHR data for health research.
