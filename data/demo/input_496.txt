Clinical cases play an instrumental role in medical school education and the 
continuing education of practicing physicians. To date, few case repositories 
are available that are interdisciplinary, searchable, or have properties 
enabling user contribution and feedback. In this research, we explored the 
design of such a system called Casepedia, using contextual inquiry and rapid 
prototyping techniques. Casepedia provides a Web 2.0 platform that will allow 
medical professionals to publish, comment on, and classify authentic cases.
