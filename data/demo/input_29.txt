OBJECTIVES: Natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning approaches 
were used to build classifiers to identify genomic-related treatment changes in 
the free-text visit progress notes of cancer patients.
METHODS: We obtained 5889 deidentified progress reports (2439 words on average) 
for 755 cancer patients who have undergone a clinical next generation sequencing 
(NGS) testing in Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center for our data 
analyses. An NLP system was implemented to process the free-text data and 
extract NGS-related information. Three types of recurrent neural network (RNN) 
namely, gated recurrent unit, long short-term memory (LSTM), and bidirectional 
LSTM (LSTM_Bi) were applied to classify documents to the treatment-change and 
no-treatment-change groups. Further, we compared the performances of RNNs to 5 
machine learning algorithms including Naive Bayes, K-nearest Neighbor, Support 
Vector Machine for classification, Random forest, and Logistic Regression.
RESULTS: Our results suggested that, overall, RNNs outperformed traditional 
machine learning algorithms, and LSTM_Bi showed the best performance among the 
RNNs in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. In addition, 
pretrained word embedding can improve the accuracy of LSTM by 3.4% and reduce 
the training time by more than 60%.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: NLP and RNN-based text mining solutions have 
demonstrated advantages in information retrieval and document classification 
tasks for unstructured clinical progress notes.
