ABNER (A Biomedical Named Entity Recognizer) is an open source software tool for 
molecular biology text mining. At its core is a machine learning system using 
conditional random fields with a variety of orthographic and contextual 
features. The latest version is 1.5, which has an intuitive graphical interface 
and includes two modules for tagging entities (e.g. protein and cell line) 
trained on standard corpora, for which performance is roughly state of the art. 
It also includes a Java application programming interface allowing users to 
incorporate ABNER into their own systems and train models on new corpora.
