Real-world data sources, including electronic health records (EHRs) and personal 
digital device data, are increasingly available, but are often siloed and cannot 
be easily integrated for clinical, research, or regulatory purposes. We 
conducted a prospective cohort study of 60 patients undergoing bariatric surgery 
or catheter-based atrial fibrillation ablation at two U.S. tertiary care 
hospitals, testing the feasibility of using a patient-centered 
health-data-sharing platform to obtain and aggregate health data from multiple 
sources. We successfully obtained EHR data for all patients at both hospitals, 
as well as from ten additional health systems, which were successfully 
aggregated with pharmacy data obtained for patients using CVS or Walgreens 
pharmacies; personal digital device data from activity monitors, digital weight 
scales, and single-lead ECGs, and patient-reported outcome measure data obtained 
through surveys to assess post-procedure recovery and disease-specific symptoms. 
A patient-centered health-data-sharing platform successfully aggregated data 
from multiple sources.
