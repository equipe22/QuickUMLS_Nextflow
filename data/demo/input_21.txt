BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The volume of biomedical literature has been 
increasing in the last years. Patent documents have also followed this trend, 
being important sources of biomedical knowledge, technical details and curated 
data, which are put together along the granting process. The field of Biomedical 
text mining (BioTM) has been creating solutions for the problems posed by the 
unstructured nature of natural language, which makes the search of information a 
challenging task. Several BioTM techniques can be applied to patents. From 
those, Information Retrieval (IR) includes processes where relevant data are 
obtained from collections of documents. In this work, the main goal was to build 
a patent pipeline addressing IR tasks over patent repositories to make these 
documents amenable to BioTM tasks.
METHODS: The pipeline was developed within @Note2, an open-source computational 
framework for BioTM, adding a number of modules to the core libraries, including 
patent metadata and full text retrieval, PDF to text conversion and optical 
character recognition. Also, user interfaces were developed for the main 
operations materialized in a new @Note2 plug-in.
RESULTS: The integration of these tools in @Note2 opens opportunities to run 
BioTM tools over patent texts, including tasks from Information Extraction, such 
as Named Entity Recognition or Relation Extraction. We demonstrated the 
pipeline's main functions with a case study, using an available benchmark 
dataset from BioCreative challenges. Also, we show the use of the plug-in with a 
user query related to the production of vanillin.
CONCLUSIONS: This work makes available all the relevant content from patents to 
the scientific community, decreasing drastically the time required for this 
task, and provides graphical interfaces to ease the use of these tools.
