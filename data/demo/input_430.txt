We present a biomedical text-mining system focused on four types of gene-related 
information: biological functions, associated diseases, related genes and 
gene-gene relations. The aim of this system is to provide researchers an 
easy-to-use bio-information service that will rapidly survey the rapidly 
burgeoning biomedical literature.
