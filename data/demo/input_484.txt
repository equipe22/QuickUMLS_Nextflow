Researchers in the life-sciences are currently limited to small-scale 
informatics experiments and analyses because of the lack of interoperability 
among life-sciences web services. This limitation can be addressed by annotating 
services and their interfaces with semantic information, so that 
interoperability problems can be reasoned about programmatically. The Moby 
semantic web framework is a popular and mature platform that is used for this 
purpose. However, the number of services that are available to select from when 
building a workflow is becoming unmanageable for users. As such, attempts have 
been made to assist with service selection and composition. These tasks fall 
under the general label of automated service composition. We present a prototype 
workflow assembly client that reduces the number of choices that users have to 
make by (1) restricting the overall set of services presented to them and (2) 
ranking services so that the the most desirable ones are presented first. We 
demonstrate via an evaluation of this prototype that a unification of relatively 
simple techniques can rank desirable services highly while maintaining 
interactive response times.
