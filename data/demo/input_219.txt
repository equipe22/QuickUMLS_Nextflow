Information on CYP-chemical interactions was comprehensively explored by a 
text-mining technique, to confirm our previous structure-activity relationship 
model for CYP substrates (Yamashita et al. J. Chem. Inf. Model. 2008, 48, 
364-369). The text-mining technique is based on natural language processing and 
can extract chemical names and their interaction patterns according to sentence 
context. After chemicals were automatically extracted and classified into CYP 
substrates, inhibitors, and inducers, 709 substrates were retrieved from the 
PubChem database and categorized as 216, 145, 136, 217, 156, and 379 substrates 
for CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4, respectively. Although 
the previous classification model was developed using data from only 161 
compounds, the model classified the substrates found by text-mining analysis 
with reasonable accuracy. This confirmed the validity of both the 
multi-objective classification model for CYP substrates and the text-mining 
procedure.
