BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In Intensive Care Units, the amount of data to be 
processed for patients care, the turn over of the patients, the necessity for 
reliability and for review processes indicate the use of Patient Data Management 
Systems (PDMS) and electronic health records (EHR). To respond to the needs of 
an Intensive Care Unit and not to be locked with proprietary software, we 
developed an EHR based on usual software and components.
METHODS: The software was designed as a client-server architecture running on 
the Windows operating system and powered by the access data base system. The 
client software was developed using Visual Basic interface library. The 
application offers to the users the following functions: medical notes captures, 
observations and treatments, nursing charts with administration of medications, 
scoring systems for classification, and possibilities to encode medical 
activities for billing processes.
RESULTS: Since his deployment in September 2004, the EHR was used to care more 
than five thousands patients with the expected software reliability and 
facilitated data management and review processes. Communications with other 
medical software were not developed from the start, and are realized by the use 
of basic functionalities communication engine. Further upgrade of the system 
will include multi-platform support, use of typed language with static analysis, 
and configurable interface.
CONCLUSION: The developed system based on usual software components was able to 
respond to the medical needs of the local ICU environment. The use of Windows 
for development allowed us to customize the software to the preexisting 
organization and contributed to the acceptability of the whole system.
