This paper introduces an overview of the Virtual Health Platform (VHP), an 
alternative approach to create a functional PHR system in a medical tourism 
environment. The proposed platform has been designed in order to be integrated 
with EHR infrastructures and in this way it expects to be useful and more 
advantageous to the patient or tourist. Use cases of the VHP and its potential 
benefits summarize the analysis.
