Nowadays, telemonitoring systems are increasingly used, due to the increasing of 
life expectancy and chronic diseases. Indeed, chronic diseases and disabilities 
due to advancing age are responsible for health care costs increasingly growing. 
Telemonitoring systems provide a low cost way to monitor patients and their 
needs in the comfort of their own homes. In first systems, the data were 
collected then sent directly to physicians to be interpreted. Nowadays, thanks 
to technological advancements, software and systems have been developed to 
process data, on a simple computer or even smartphone. In this paper, we present 
e-Care telemonitoring system that combines the semantic web and expert system. 
E-Care is based on generic ontologies and a decision support system. The 
decision support system uses ontologies as knowledge base and an inference 
engine to detect abnormal situations. E-Care platform has a generic open 
architecture, which cans include other knowledge coming from other systems. 
We'll show how to integrate data of auscultation sounds in this architecture.
