INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to develop a semiautomated 
approach to screening cases that describe hazards associated with the electronic 
health record (EHR) from a mandatory, population-based patient safety reporting 
system.
METHODS: Potentially relevant cases were identified through a query of the 
Pennsylvania Patient Safety Reporting System. A random sample of cases were 
manually screened for relevance and divided into training, testing, and 
validation data sets to develop a machine learning model. This model was used to 
automate screening of remaining potentially relevant cases.
RESULTS: Of the 4 algorithms tested, a naive Bayes kernel performed best, with 
an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.927 ± 0.023, 
accuracy of 0.855 ± 0.033, and F score of 0.877 ± 0.027.
DISCUSSION: The machine learning model and text mining approach described here 
are useful tools for identifying and analyzing adverse event and near-miss 
reports. Although reporting systems are beginning to incorporate structured 
fields on health information technology and the EHR, these methods can identify 
related events that reporters classify in other ways. These methods can 
facilitate analysis of legacy safety reports by retrieving health information 
technology-related and EHR-related events from databases without fields and 
controlled values focused on this subject and distinguishing them from reports 
in which the EHR is mentioned only in passing.
CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning and text mining are useful additions to the 
patient safety toolkit and can be used to semiautomate screening and analysis of 
unstructured text in safety reports from frontline staff.
