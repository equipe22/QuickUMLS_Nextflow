BACKGROUND: Although the presence of an electronic health record (EHR) alone 
does not ensure high quality, efficient care, few studies have focused on the 
work of those charged with optimising use of existing EHR functionality.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the approaches used and challenges perceived by analysts 
supporting the optimisation of primary care teams' EHR use at a large U.S. 
academic health care system.
METHODS: A qualitative study was conducted. Optimisation analysts and their 
supervisor were interviewed and data were analysed for themes.
RESULTS: Analysts needed to reconcile the tension created by organisational 
mandates focused on the standardisation of EHR processes with the primary care 
teams' demand for EHR customisation. They gained an understanding of health 
information technology (HIT) leadership's and primary care team's goals through 
attending meetings, reading meeting minutes and visiting with clinical teams. 
Within what was organisationally possible, EHR education could then be tailored 
to fit team needs. Major challenges were related to organisational attempts to 
standardise EHR use despite varied clinic contexts, personnel readiness and 
technical issues with the EHR platform. Forcing standardisation upon clinical 
needs that current EHR functionality could not satisfy was difficult.
CONCLUSIONS: Dedicated optimisation analysts can add value to health systems 
through playing a mediating role between HIT leadership and care teams. Our 
findings imply that EHR optimisation should be performed with an in-depth 
understanding of the workflow, cognitive and interactional activities in primary 
care.
