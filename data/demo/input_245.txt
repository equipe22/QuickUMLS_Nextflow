Document collections resulting from searches in the biomedical literature, for 
instance, in PubMed, are often so large that some organization of the returned 
information is necessary. Clustering is an efficient tool for organizing search 
results. To help the user to decide how to continue the search for relevant 
documents, the content of each cluster can be characterized by a set of 
representative keywords or cluster labels. As different users may have different 
interests, it can be desirable with solutions that make it possible to produce 
labels from a selection of different topical categories. We therefore introduce 
the concept of multi-focus cluster labeling to give users the possibility to get 
an overview of the contents through labels from multiple viewpoints. The concept 
for multi-focus cluster labeling has been established and has been demonstrated 
on three different document collections. We illustrate that multi-focus 
visualizations can give an overview of clusters along axes that general labels 
are not able to convey. The approach is generic and should be applicable to any 
biomedical (or other) domain with any selection of foci where appropriate focus 
vocabularies can be established. A user evaluation also indicates that such a 
multi-focus concept is useful.
