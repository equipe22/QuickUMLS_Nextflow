Electronic health record systems (EHRs) play an increasingly important role in 
opioid agonist treatment. In Italy, an EHR called the Multi Functional Platform 
(MFP) is in use in 150 opioid-agonist treatment facilities in 8 of Italy's 23 
regions. This report describes MFP and presents 2010 data from 65 sites that 
treated 8145 patients, of whom 72.3% were treated with methadone and 27.7% with 
buprenorphine. Patients treated with buprenorphine compared to methadone were 
more likely to be male (p < .01) and younger (p < .001). Methadone compared to 
buprenorphine patients had a higher percentage of opioid-positive urine tests (p 
< .001) and longer mean length of stay (p = .004). MFP has been implemented 
widely in Italy and has been able to track patient outcomes across treatment 
facilities. In the future, this EHR system can be used for performance 
improvement initiatives.
