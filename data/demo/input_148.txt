OBJECTIVE: To create a sense inventory of abbreviations and acronyms from 
clinical texts.
METHODS: The most frequently occurring abbreviations and acronyms from 352,267 
dictated clinical notes were used to create a clinical sense inventory. Senses 
of each abbreviation and acronym were manually annotated from 500 random 
instances and lexically matched with long forms within the Unified Medical 
Language System (UMLS V.2011AB), Another Database of Abbreviations in Medline 
(ADAM), and Stedman's Dictionary, Medical Abbreviations, Acronyms & Symbols, 4th 
edition (Stedman's). Redundant long forms were merged after they were lexically 
normalized using Lexical Variant Generation (LVG).
RESULTS: The clinical sense inventory was found to have skewed sense 
distributions, practice-specific senses, and incorrect uses. Of 440 
abbreviations and acronyms analyzed in this study, 949 long forms were 
identified in clinical notes. This set was mapped to 17,359, 5233, and 4879 long 
forms in UMLS, ADAM, and Stedman's, respectively. After merging long forms, only 
2.3% matched across all medical resources. The UMLS, ADAM, and Stedman's covered 
5.7%, 8.4%, and 11% of the merged clinical long forms, respectively. The sense 
inventory of clinical abbreviations and acronyms and anonymized datasets 
generated from this study are available for public use at 
http://www.bmhi.umn.edu/ihi/research/nlpie/resources/index.htm ('Sense 
Inventories', website).
CONCLUSIONS: Clinical sense inventories of abbreviations and acronyms created 
using clinical notes and medical dictionary resources demonstrate challenges 
with term coverage and resource integration. Further work is needed to help with 
standardizing abbreviations and acronyms in clinical care and biomedicine to 
facilitate automated processes such as text-mining and information extraction.
