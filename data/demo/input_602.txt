PURPOSE: Adding value of care to patients is crucial for all stakeholders. The 
use of both provider and patient reported outcome data was implemented in a 
single academic breast cancer center. We describe the development of the 
outcomes set, data integration within electronical health records (EHR) and 
clinical use.
METHODS: An Integrated Practice Unit (IPU) was constructed providing the full 
care cycle for breast cancer patients. Provider reported outcomes and patient 
reported outcomes (PROs) were defined, reflecting the entire cycle of care and 
long-term sustainability of quality of life. Multidisciplinary provider and 
patient perspectives were obtained via focus groups and surveys. Patient 
pathways were redesigned in order to identify suitable opportunities for data 
collection during the entire care cycle.
RESULTS: A Standard Set for Breast Cancer Outcomes together with case-mix 
variables and timelines was agreed upon within the IPU. A secure electronic 
platform, directly linked to the EHR, was designed to measure PROs during the 
outpatient phase. First year evaluation showed a decrease of response rates over 
time, from 83.3% at baseline to 45.2% at 12 months after surgery. Patients 
reacted positively to the use of PROMs in daily clinical cancer care.
CONCLUSION: Assessment of patient reported as well as provider reported outcomes 
was implemented within our standard of breast cancer care. For this, dedicated 
resources, change of culture and practice, and improved knowledge and awareness 
about Value-based healthcare (VBHC) were essential. Our proposed framework aims 
to serve as a blueprint for implementation of VBHC in daily care.
