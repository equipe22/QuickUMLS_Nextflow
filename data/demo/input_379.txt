Identifying unknown drug interactions is of great benefit in the early detection 
of adverse drug reactions. Despite existence of several resources for drug-drug 
interaction (DDI) information, the wealth of such information is buried in a 
body of unstructured medical text which is growing exponentially. This calls for 
developing text mining techniques for identifying DDIs. The state-of-the-art DDI 
extraction methods use Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with non-linear composite 
kernels to explore diverse contexts in literature. While computationally less 
expensive, linear kernel-based systems have not achieved a comparable 
performance in DDI extraction tasks. In this work, we propose an efficient and 
scalable system using a linear kernel to identify DDI information. The proposed 
approach consists of two steps: identifying DDIs and assigning one of four 
different DDI types to the predicted drug pairs. We demonstrate that when 
equipped with a rich set of lexical and syntactic features, a linear SVM 
classifier is able to achieve a competitive performance in detecting DDIs. In 
addition, the one-against-one strategy proves vital for addressing an imbalance 
issue in DDI type classification. Applied to the DDIExtraction 2013 corpus, our 
system achieves an F1 score of 0.670, as compared to 0.651 and 0.609 reported by 
the top two participating teams in the DDIExtraction 2013 challenge, both based 
on non-linear kernel methods.
