The immense growth in the volume of research literature and experimental data in 
the field of molecular biology calls for efficient automatic methods to capture 
and store information. In recent years, several groups have worked on specific 
problems in this area, such as automated selection of articles pertinent to 
molecular biology, or automated extraction of information using natural-language 
processing, information visualization, and generation of specialized knowledge 
bases for molecular biology. GeneWays is an integrated system that combines 
several such subtasks. It analyzes interactions between molecular substances, 
drawing on multiple sources of information to infer a consensus view of 
molecular networks. GeneWays is designed as an open platform, allowing 
researchers to query, review, and critique stored information.
