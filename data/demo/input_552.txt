BACKGROUND: Clinical Trials (CTs) are indispensable instruments for 
evidence-based medicine and frequently necessitate the management, sharing and 
analysis of large amounts of data amongst partners in different locations.
METHODS: To effectively satisfy these requirements, the proposed solution 
combines a web platform and a Clinical Data Management System (CDMS) to exploit 
the strengths of Electronic Health Records (EHR) and Electronic Data Capture 
(EDC) systems. The core of the proposal is a relational database which has high 
data structuring characteristics and utilises biomedical controlled vocabularies 
(e.g. LOINC and ICD). In addition, units and normality ranges were collected for 
data comparison through the application of the Z-score transformation.
RESULTS: The obtained CDMS preserves the EDC's flexibility and user autonomy and 
permits the creation of patient cohorts, as in the EHR. Accordingly, clinical 
information, after the initial recording, is available for different 
simultaneous multicentre CTs. Furthermore, interface runtime controls guarantee 
high data quality during data entering processes. Currently, the proposed system 
has been developed in the HIV and eye diseases fields in Italy.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed solution is flexible and suitable to perform 
multicentre research within a varying range of medical domains. In the future, 
the automatic importation of information from hospitals has been planned through 
an HL7 standard interface which would improve both data quantity and quality.
