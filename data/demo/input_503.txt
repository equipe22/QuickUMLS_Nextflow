EHRs can now be adapted to integrate seamlessly with existing research 
platforms. However, key challenges need to be overcome in order to provide a 
platform that functions across many EHR systems. The IHE Quality, Research and 
Public Health (QRPH) domain addresses the information exchange standards 
necessary to share information relevant to quality improvement in patient care 
and clinical research. In collaboration with CDISC's Healthcare Link initiative, 
IHE QRPH has developed a set of integration profiles that specifically address 
EHR-enabled research. The panel participants from three European projects will 
present how subsets of existing IHE QRPH profiles can be pulled together (and 
extended when necessary) to form a super profile which will standardize and 
automate the clinical trial process flow. The EHR4CR project is providing 
adaptable, reusable and scalable tools and services for reusing data from 
hospital EHRs for Clinical Research. TRANSFoRm is developing an informatics 
infrastructure to support the learning healthcare system in European Primary 
Care. SALUS project is providing scalable, standard based interoperability 
framework for sustainable proactive post market safety studies. Overall, the 
panel will discuss the key steps towards realizing a joint 
EHR4CR/TRANSFoRm/SALUS European projectathon demonstrating EHR-enabled clinical 
research across Europe using standard-based integration and content profiles.
