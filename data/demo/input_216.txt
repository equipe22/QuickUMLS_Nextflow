BACKGROUND: Automatically detecting gene/protein names in the literature and 
connecting them to databases records, also known as gene normalization, provides 
a means to structure the information buried in free-text literature. Gene 
normalization is critical for improving the coverage of annotation in the 
databases, and is an essential component of many text mining systems and 
database curation pipelines.
METHODS: In this manuscript, we describe a gene normalization system 
specifically tailored for plant species, called pGenN (pivot-based Gene 
Normalization). The system consists of three steps: dictionary-based gene 
mention detection, species assignment, and intra species normalization. We have 
developed new heuristics to improve each of these phases.
RESULTS: We evaluated the performance of pGenN on an in-house expertly annotated 
corpus consisting of 104 plant relevant abstracts. Our system achieved an 
F-value of 88.9% (Precision 90.9% and Recall 87.2%) on this corpus, 
outperforming state-of-art systems presented in BioCreative III. We have 
processed over 440,000 plant-related Medline abstracts using pGenN. The gene 
normalization results are stored in a local database for direct query from the 
pGenN web interface (proteininformationresource.org/pgenn/). The annotated 
literature corpus is also publicly available through the PIR text mining portal 
(proteininformationresource.org/iprolink/).
