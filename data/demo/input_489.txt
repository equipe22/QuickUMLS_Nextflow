An information brokerage environment for effective information structuring, 
indexing, and retrieval in the health-care administration sector is presented. 
The system is based on ontology modeling, natural language processing, 
extensible markup language, semantics analysis, and behavioral description. 
Semantics-based information acquisition is achieved through the uniform 
modeling, representation, and handling of domain-specific knowledge, both 
content-based and procedural. The system has been validated using information 
located on several repositories in the web and its performance is reported in 
terms of precision and recall.
