Clinical trials are mandatory protocols describing medical research on humans 
and among the most valuable sources of medical practice evidence. Searching for 
trials relevant to some query is laborious due to the immense number of existing 
protocols. Apart from search, writing new trials includes composing detailed 
eligibility criteria, which might be time-consuming, especially for new 
researchers. In this paper we present ASCOT, an efficient search application 
customised for clinical trials. ASCOT uses text mining and data mining methods 
to enrich clinical trials with metadata, that in turn serve as effective tools 
to narrow down search. In addition, ASCOT integrates a component for 
recommending eligibility criteria based on a set of selected protocols.
