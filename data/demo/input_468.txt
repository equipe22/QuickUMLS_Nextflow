The contents of parentheses in biomedical text have many potential uses in text 
mining applications. However, making use of them requires the ability to 
determine what class of contents they are. A system that automatically 
classifies parenthesized text into one of 20 categories is presented and 
evaluated here. It performs at a micro-averaged accuracy of 68% and a 
macro-averaged accuracy of 60% on an annotated corpus. The application is 
available as a Java class and as a Perl module.
