BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the most common malignancy to spread to the orbit 
and periorbit, and the invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) histologic subtype of 
breast cancer has been reported to form these ophthalmic metastases (OM) more 
frequently than invasive ductal carcinomas (IDC). We herein report our single 
academic institution experience with breast cancer OM with respect to anatomical 
presentation, histology (lobular vs. ductal), treatment, and survival.
METHODS: We employed the natural language processing platform, TIES (Text 
Information Extraction System), to search 2.3 million de-identified patient 
pathology and radiology records at our institution in order to identify patients 
with OM secondary to breast cancer. We then compared the resultant cohort, the 
"OM cohort," to two other representative metastatic breast cancer patient (MBC) 
databases from our institution. Histological analysis of selected patients was 
performed.
RESULTS: Our TIES search and manual refinement ultimately identified 28 patients 
who were diagnosed with breast cancer between 1995 and 2016 that subsequently 
developed OM. Median age at diagnosis was 54 (range 28-77) years of age. ER, PR, 
and HER2 status from the 28 patients with OM did not differ from other patients 
with MBC from our institution. The relative proportion of patients with ILC was 
significantly higher in the OM cohort (32.1%) than in other MBC patients in our 
institution (11.3%, p = 0.007). Median time to first OM in the OM cohort was 
46.7 months, and OM were the second most frequent first metastases after bony 
metastases. After diagnosis of the first distant metastasis of any kind, median 
survival of patients with ILC (21.4 months) was significantly shorter than that 
of patients with IDC (55.3 months, p = 0.03). Nine patients developed bilateral 
OM. We observed a significant co-occurrence of OM and central nervous system 
metastases (p = 0.0053). The histological analysis revealed an interesting case 
in which the primary tumor was of a mixed ILC/IDC subtype, while only ILC was 
present in the OM.
CONCLUSIONS: OM from breast cancer are illustrative of the difference in 
metastatic behavior of ILC versus IDC and should be considered when treating 
patients with ILC, especially in those with complaints of visual acuity changes.
