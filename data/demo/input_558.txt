This paper discusses the topic of data quality, which concerns the global 
research and business community and constitutes a challenging task. The data 
quality prerequisite becomes even more critical when it pertains to critical and 
sensitive data, such as the healthcare domain data. To begin with, the paper 
outlines the basic definitions and concepts of data quality and its dimensions. 
The related research work on data quality assessment is presented and our 
approach for data quality assurance is introduced. This approach is implemented 
in our designed cloud platform, called MODELHealth, which is intended for 
supporting clinical work and administrative decision-making process.
