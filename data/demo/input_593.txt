BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Screening for substance use disorder (SUD) in general 
medical settings may be particularly important in patients with comorbid health 
conditions exacerbated by SUD. This study evaluated whether SUD is associated 
with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) complications in patients with co-occurring 
T2DM and hypertension.
DESIGN: Analysis of a limited data set obtained through IBM Watson Health 
Explorys, a platform integrating data from electronic health records. Matched 
controls were defined for each of five SUDs: tobacco use disorder (TUD), opioid 
use disorder (OUD), cocaine use disorder, cannabis use disorder (CUD) and 
alcohol use disorder (AUD) using Mahalanobis distance within propensity score 
calipers.
SETTING: All patients were seen in the MetroHealth System (Cleveland, OH, USA) 
and had diagnosis codes for T2DM and hypertension.
PARTICIPANTS: SUD group participants had a diagnosis of abuse/dependence for the 
substance of interest. Controls for each SUD group had no diagnosis code related 
to the SUD of interest and were selected to match the SUD patients on 
demographics, residential zip code median income and body mass index. Total 
sample sizes for each SUD-control comparison ranged from 1160 for CUD to 22 128 
for TUD.
MEASUREMENTS: Outcome was diagnosis (yes/no) of four T2DM complications 
(cerebrovascular accident, diabetic neuropathy, diabetic renal disease, 
myocardial infarction) and all-cause mortality.
FINDINGS: Logistic regressions revealed that SUD was significantly associated 
with greater risk of cerebrovascular accident [TUD odds ratio (OR) = 1.79, 
OUD-OR = 1.94, cocaine use disorder OR = 2.67], diabetic neuropathy 
[TUD-adjusted OR (aOR) = 1.47, cocaine use disorder-aOR = 1.35, AUD-aOR = 1.27], 
diabetic renal disease (TUD-aOR = 1.25, OUD-OR = 1.34), myocardial infarction 
(TUD-OR = 1.96, OUD-OR = 2.01, cocaine use disorder-OR = 2.68, CUD-OR = 2.48, 
AUD-OR = 1.42) and mortality (TUD-OR = 1.15, cocaine use disorder-OR = 1.61, 
CUD-OR = 1.49, AUD-OR = 1.35).
CONCLUSIONS: Among patients in Ohio USA with both type 2 diabetes mellitus 
(T2DM) and hypertension, those with substance use disorders appear to have 
greater risk for T2DM complications and all-cause mortality.
