Automated extraction of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) from biomedical 
literatures is an important topic of biomedical text mining. In this paper, we 
propose an approach based on neighborhood hash graph kernel for this task. In 
contrast to the existing graph kernel-based approaches for PPI extraction, the 
proposed approach not only has the capability to make use of full dependency 
graphs to represent the sentence structure but also effectively control the 
computational complexity. We evaluate the proposed approach on five publicly 
available PPI corpora and perform detailed comparisons with other approaches. 
The experimental result shows that our approach is comparable to the 
state-of-the-art PPI extraction system and much faster than all-path graph 
kernel approach on all five PPI corpora.
