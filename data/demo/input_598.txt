Patient-generated health data (PGHD), collected from mobile apps and devices, 
represents an opportunity for remote patient monitoring and timely interventions 
to prevent acute exacerbations of chronic illness-if data are seen and shared by 
care teams. This case report describes the technical aspects of integrating data 
from a popular smartphone platform to a commonly used EHR vendor and explores 
the challenges and potential of this approach for disease management. Consented 
subjects using the Asthma Health app (built on Apple's ResearchKit platform) 
were able to share data on inhaler usage and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) 
with a local pulmonologist who ordered this data on Epic's EHR. For users who 
had installed and activated Epic's patient portal (MyChart) on their iPhone and 
enabled sharing of health data between apps via HealthKit, the pulmonologist 
could review PGHD and, if necessary, make recommendations. Four patients agreed 
to share data with their pulmonologist, though only two patients submitted more 
than one data point across the 4.5-month trial period. One of these patients 
submitted 101 PEFR readings across 65 days; another submitted 24 PEFR and 
inhaler usage readings across 66 days. PEFR for both patients fell within 
predefined physiologic parameters, except once where a low threshold 
notification was sent to the pulmonologist, who responded with a telephone 
discussion and new e-prescription to address symptoms. This research describes 
the technical considerations and implementation challenges of using commonly 
available frameworks for sharing PGHD, for the purpose of remote monitoring to 
support timely care interventions.
