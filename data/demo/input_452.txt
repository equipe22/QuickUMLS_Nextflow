This work deals with negation detection in the context of clinical texts. 
Negation detection is a key for decision support systems since negated events 
(detection of absence of some events) help ascertain current medical conditions. 
For artificial intelligence, negation detection is a valuable point as it can 
revert the meaning of a part of a text and, accordingly, influence other tasks 
such as medical dosage adjustment, the detection of adverse drug reactions or 
hospital acquired diseases. We focus on negated medical events such as 
disorders, findings and allergies. From Natural Language Processing (NLP) 
background, we refer to them as negated medical entities. A novelty of this work 
is that we approached this task as Named Entity Recognition (NER) with the 
restriction that just negated medical entities must be recognized (in an attempt 
to help distinguish them from non-negated ones). Our study is driven with 
Electronic Health Records (EHRs) written in Spanish. A challenge to cope with is 
the lexical variability (alternative medical forms, abbreviations, etc.). To 
this end, we employed an approach based on deep learning. Specifically, the 
system combines character embeddings to cope with out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words, 
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to model contextual representations and 
it makes use of Conditional Random Fields (CRF) to classify each medical entity 
as either negated or not given the contextual dense representation. Moreover, we 
explored both embeddings created from words and embeddings created from lemmas. 
The best results were obtained with the lemmatized embeddings. Apparently, this 
approach reinforced the capability of the LSTMs to cope with the high lexical 
variability. The f-measure for exact-match was 65.1 and 82.4 for the 
partial-match.
