Machine Learning Approaches on Diagnostic Term Encoding With the ICD for 
Clinical Documentation.

This work focuses on data mining applied to the clinical documentation domain. 
Diagnostic terms (DTs) are used as keywords to retrieve valuable information 
from electronic health records. Indeed, they are encoded manually by experts 
following the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). The goal of this 
work is to explore the aid of text mining on DT encoding. From the machine 
learning (ML) perspective, this is a high-dimensional classification task, as it 
comprises thousands of codes. This work delves into a robust representation of 
the instances to improve ML results. The proposed system is able to find the 
right ICD code among more than 1500 possible ICD codes with 92% precision for 
the main disease (primary class) and 88% for the main disease together with the 
nonessential modifiers (fully specified class). The methodology employed is 
simple and portable. According to the experts from public hospitals, the system 
is very useful in particular for documentation and pharmacosurveillance 
services. In fact, they reported an accuracy of 91.2% on a small randomly 
extracted test. Hence, together with this paper, we made the software publicly 
available in order to help the clinical and research community.
