The 2014 i2b2 natural language processing shared task focused on identifying 
cardiovascular risk factors such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol 
levels, obesity and smoking status among other factors found in health records 
of diabetic patients. In addition, the task involved detecting medications, and 
time information associated with the extracted data. This paper presents the 
development and evaluation of a natural language processing (NLP) application 
conceived for this i2b2 shared task. For increased efficiency, the application 
main components were adapted from two existing NLP tools implemented in the 
Apache UIMA framework: Textractor (for dictionary-based lookup) and cTAKES (for 
preprocessing and smoking status detection). The application achieved a final 
(micro-averaged) F1-measure of 87.5% on the final evaluation test set. Our 
attempt was mostly based on existing tools adapted with minimal changes and 
allowed for satisfying performance with limited development efforts.
