Literature in the field of nanotechnology is exponentially increasing with more 
and more engineered nanomaterials being created, characterized, and tested for 
performance and safety. With the deluge of published data, there is a need for 
natural language processing approaches to semi-automate the cataloguing of 
engineered nanomaterials and their associated physico-chemical properties, 
performance, exposure scenarios, and biological effects. In this paper, we 
review the different informatics methods that have been applied to patent 
mining, nanomaterial/device characterization, nanomedicine, and environmental 
risk assessment. Nine natural language processing (NLP)-based tools were 
identified: NanoPort, NanoMapper, TechPerceptor, a Text Mining Framework, a 
Nanodevice Analyzer, a Clinical Trial Document Classifier, Nanotoxicity 
Searcher, NanoSifter, and NEIMiner. We conclude with recommendations for sharing 
NLP-related tools through online repositories to broaden participation in 
nanoinformatics.
