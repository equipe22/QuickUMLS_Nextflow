Biomedical texts can be typically represented by four rhetorical categories: 
Introduction, Methods, Results and Discussion (IMRAD). Classifying sentences 
into these categories can benefit many other text-mining tasks. Although many 
studies have applied different approaches for automatically classifying 
sentences in MEDLINE abstracts into the IMRAD categories, few have explored the 
classification of sentences that appear in full-text biomedical articles. We 
first evaluated whether sentences in full-text biomedical articles could be 
reliably annotated into the IMRAD format and then explored different approaches 
for automatically classifying these sentences into the IMRAD categories. Our 
results show an overall annotation agreement of 82.14% with a Kappa score of 
0.756. The best classification system is a multinomial na√Øve Bayes classifier 
trained on manually annotated data that achieved 91.95% accuracy and an average 
F-score of 91.55%, which is significantly higher than baseline systems. A web 
version of this system is available online
