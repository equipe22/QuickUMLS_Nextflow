OpenMRS is an open-source, robust electronic health record (EHR) platform that 
is supported by a large global network and used in over forty countries. We 
explored what factors lead to successful implementation of OpenMRS in resource 
constrained settings. Data sources included in-person and telephone key 
informant interviews, focus groups and responses to an electronic survey from 10 
sites in 7 countries. Qualitative data was coded through independent coding, 
discussion and consensus. The most common perceived benefits of implementation 
were for providing clinical care, reporting to funders, managing operations and 
research. Successful implementation factors include securing adequate 
infrastructure, and sociotechnical system factors, particularly adequate 
staffing, computers, and ability to use software. Strategic and tactical 
planning were successful strategies, including understanding and addressing the 
infrastructure and human costs involved, training or hiring personnel 
technically capable of modifying the software and integrating it into the daily 
work flow to meet clinicians' needs.
