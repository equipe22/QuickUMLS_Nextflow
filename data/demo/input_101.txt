BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: In order for computers to extract useful information 
from unstructured text, a concept normalization system is needed to link 
relevant concepts in a text to sources that contain further information about 
the concept. Popular concept normalization tools in the biomedical field are 
dictionary-based. In this study we investigate the usefulness of natural 
language processing (NLP) as an adjunct to dictionary-based concept 
normalization.
METHODS: We compared the performance of two biomedical concept normalization 
systems, MetaMap and Peregrine, on the Arizona Disease Corpus, with and without 
the use of a rule-based NLP module. Performance was assessed for exact and 
inexact boundary matching of the system annotations with those of the gold 
standard and for concept identifier matching.
RESULTS: Without the NLP module, MetaMap and Peregrine attained F-scores of 
61.0% and 63.9%, respectively, for exact boundary matching, and 55.1% and 56.9% 
for concept identifier matching. With the aid of the NLP module, the F-scores of 
MetaMap and Peregrine improved to 73.3% and 78.0% for boundary matching, and to 
66.2% and 69.8% for concept identifier matching. For inexact boundary matching, 
performances further increased to 85.5% and 85.4%, and to 73.6% and 73.3% for 
concept identifier matching.
CONCLUSIONS: We have shown the added value of NLP for the recognition and 
normalization of diseases with MetaMap and Peregrine. The NLP module is general 
and can be applied in combination with any concept normalization system. Whether 
its use for concept types other than disease is equally advantageous remains to 
be investigated.
