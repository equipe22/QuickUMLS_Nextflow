In 2001, we developed an EHR system for regional healthcare information 
inter-exchange and to provide individual patient data to patients. This system 
was adopted in three regions in Japan. We also developed a Medical Markup 
Language (MML) standard for inter- and intra-hospital communications. The system 
was built on a legacy platform, however, and had not been appropriately 
maintained or updated to meet clinical requirements. To improve future 
maintenance costs, we reconstructed the EHR system using archetype technology on 
the Ruby on Rails platform, and generated MML equivalent forms from archetypes. 
The system was deployed as a cloud-based system for preliminary use as a 
regional EHR. The system now has the capability to catch up with new 
requirements, maintaining semantic interoperability with archetype technology. 
It is also more flexible than the legacy EHR system.
