BACKGROUND: Cannabis use is a potential risk factor for respiratory disease but 
its role apart from tobacco use is unclear. We evaluated the association between 
regular cannabis use, with and without tobacco co-use, and onset of asthma, 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and pneumonia.
METHODS: Analysis of a limited data set obtained through IBM Watson Health 
Explorys, an electronic-health-record-integration platform. Matched controls 
using Mahalanobis distance within propensity score calipers were defined for: 1) 
cannabis-using patients (n = 8932); and subgroups of cannabis-using patients: 2) 
with an encounter diagnosis for tobacco use disorder (TUD; n = 4678); and 3) 
without a TUD diagnosis (non-TUD; n = 4254). Patients had at least: one recorded 
blood pressure measurement and one blood chemistry lab result in the MetroHealth 
System (Cleveland, Ohio). Cannabis-using patients had an encounter diagnosis of 
cannabis abuse/dependence and/or ≥2 cannabis-positive urine drug screens (UDSs). 
Control patients, not having cannabis-related diagnoses or cannabis-positive 
UDSs, were matched to the cannabis-using patients on demographics, residential 
zip code median income, body mass index, and, for the total sample, TUD-status.
RESULTS: Regular cannabis use was significantly associated with greater risk for 
asthma (odds ratio (OR) = 1.44; adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.50; OR = 1.32), 
COPD (OR = 1.56; aOR = 1.44; OR = 2.17), and pneumonia (OR = 1.80; OR = 1.84; 
OR = 2.13) in the total sample and TUD and non-TUD subgroups, respectively. 
TUD-patients had the greatest prevalence of respiratory disease, regardless of 
cannabis-use indication.
CONCLUSIONS: Regular cannabis use is associated with significantly greater risk 
of respiratory disease regardless of TUD status. Future research to understand 
the impact of cannabis use on respiratory health is warranted.
