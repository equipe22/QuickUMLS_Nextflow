Community challenges in biomedical text mining over 10 years: success, failure 
and the future.

Huang CC, Lu Z.

One effective way to improve the state of the art is through competitions. 
Following the success of the Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction 
(CASP) in bioinformatics research, a number of challenge evaluations have been 
organized by the text-mining research community to assess and advance natural 
language processing (NLP) research for biomedicine. In this article, we review 
the different community challenge evaluations held from 2002 to 2014 and their 
respective tasks. Furthermore, we examine these challenge tasks through their 
targeted problems in NLP research and biomedical applications, respectively. 
Next, we describe the general workflow of organizing a Biomedical NLP (BioNLP) 
challenge and involved stakeholders (task organizers, task data producers, task 
participants and end users). Finally, we summarize the impact and contributions 
by taking into account different BioNLP challenges as a whole, followed by a 
discussion of their limitations and difficulties. We conclude with future trends 
in BioNLP challenge evaluations.
