Gene symbol disambiguation is an important problem for biomedical text mining 
systems. When detecting gene symbols in MEDLINE citations one of the biggest 
challenges is the fact that many gene symbols also denote other, more general 
biomedical concepts (e.g. CT, MR). Our approach to this problem is first to 
classify the citations into genetic and non-genetic domains and then to detect 
gene symbols only in the genetic domain. We used ontological information 
provided by Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) for this classification task. The 
proposed algorithm is fast and is able to process the full MEDLINE distribution 
in a few hours. It achieves predictive accuracy of 0.91. The algorithm is 
currently implemented in the BITOLA literature-based discovery support system 
(http://www.mf.uni-lj.si/bitola/).
