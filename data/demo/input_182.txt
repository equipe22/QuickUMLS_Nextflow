Karyotyping, or visually examining and recording chromosomal abnormalities, is 
commonly used to diagnose and treat disease. Karyotypes are written in the 
International System for Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature (ISCN), a 
computationally non-readable language that precludes full analysis of these 
genomic data. In response, we developed a cytogenetic platform that transfers 
the ISCN karyotypes to a machine-readable model available for computational 
analysis. Here we use cytogenetic data from the National Cancer Institute 
(NCI)-curated Mitelman database1 to create a structured karyotype language. 
Then, drug-gene-disease triplets are generated via a computational pipeline 
connecting public drug-gene interaction data sources to identify potential drug 
repurposing opportunities.
