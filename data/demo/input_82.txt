Comparative effectiveness research (CER) provides evidence for the relative 
effectiveness and risks of different treatment options and informs decisions 
made by healthcare providers, payers, and pharmaceutical companies. CER data 
come from retrospective analyses as well as prospective clinical trials. Here, 
we describe the development of a text-mining pipeline based on natural language 
processing (NLP) that extracts key information from three different trial data 
sources: NIH ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry 
Platform (ICTRP), and Citeline Trialtrove. The pipeline leverages tailored 
terminologies to produce an integrated and structured output, capturing any 
trials in which pharmaceutical products of interest are compared with another 
therapy. The timely information alerts generated by this system provide the 
earliest and most complete picture of emerging clinical research.
