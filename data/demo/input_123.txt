OBJECTIVE: Achieving unbiased recognition of eligible patients for clinical 
trials from their narrative longitudinal clinical records can be time consuming. 
We describe and evaluate a knowledge-driven method that identifies whether a 
patient meets a selected set of 13 eligibility clinical trial criteria from 
their longitudinal clinical records, which was one of the tasks of the 2018 
National NLP Clinical Challenges.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The approach developed uses rules combined with manually 
crafted dictionaries that characterize the domain. The rules are based on common 
syntactical patterns observed in text indicating or describing explicitly a 
criterion. Certain criteria were classified as "met" only when they occurred 
within a designated time period prior to the most recent narrative of a patient 
record and were dealt through their position in text.
RESULTS: The system was applied to an evaluation set of 86 unseen clinical 
records and achieved a microaverage F1-score of 89.1% (with a micro F1-score of 
87.0% and 91.2% for the patients that met and did not meet the criteria, 
respectively). Most criteria returned reliable results (drug abuse, 92.5%; 
Hba1c, 91.3%) while few (eg, advanced coronary artery disease, 72.0%; myocardial 
infarction within 6 months of the most recent narrative, 47.5%) proved 
challenging enough.
CONCLUSION: Overall, the results are encouraging and indicate that automated 
text mining methods can be used to process clinical records to recognize whether 
a patient meets a set of clinical trial criteria and could be leveraged to 
reduce the workload of humans screening patients for trials.
