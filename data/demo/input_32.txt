Understanding metabolic pathways is one of the most important fields in 
bioscience in the post-genomic era, but curating metabolic pathways requires 
considerable man-power. As such there is a lack of reliable, experimentally 
verified metabolic pathways in databases and databases are forced to predict all 
but the most immediately useful pathways.Text-mining has the potential to solve 
this problem, but while sophisticated text-mining methods have been developed to 
assist the curation of many types of biomedical networks, such as 
protein-protein interaction networks, the mining of metabolic pathways from the 
literature has been largely neglected by the text-mining community. In this 
chapter we describe a pipeline for the extraction of metabolic pathways built on 
freely available open-source components and a heuristic metabolic reaction 
extraction algorithm.
