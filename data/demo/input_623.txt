Radiology and Enterprise Medical Imaging Extensions (REMIX) is a platform 
originally designed to both support the medical imaging-driven clinical and 
clinical research operational needs of Department of Radiology of The Ohio State 
University Wexner Medical Center. REMIX accommodates the storage and handling of 
"big imaging data," as needed for large multi-disciplinary cancer-focused 
programs. The evolving REMIX platform contains an array of integrated 
tools/software packages for the following: (1) server and storage management; 
(2) image reconstruction; (3) digital pathology; (4) de-identification; (5) 
business intelligence; (6) texture analysis; and (7) artificial intelligence. 
These capabilities, along with documentation and guidance, explaining how to 
interact with a commercial system (e.g., PACS, EHR, commercial database) that 
currently exists in clinical environments, are to be made freely available.
