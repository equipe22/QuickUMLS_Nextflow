# How to use

## 1) Add MRSTY.RRF and MRCONSO.RRF in the UMLS folder.


## 2)  Build the image
To build both the client and the server image run 

```bash

    make build

```

```


### Â b) start the server it will be available from port localhost:8080

```bash

    make startServer

```

NB: if you want to change the server port modify it in bin/startServer.sh
Furthermore we create a docker network to ease the communication with the docker client.

## 4) Live demo with the client

### a) start client

```bash

    make liveDemo

```


NB: It will take as input data in folder data

### b) call the script

An example of client, server interaction is located on src/quickumls_main.py


```bash

    #in the container run 
    python3 /home/quickumls/src/client.py --serverName quickumlsserver --inputFile /home/quickumls/tmp/demo/input_1.txt 

```

## 4) RUN nexflow and analyse all the demo data folder
The user need to install nexflow as required

### a) Generate Nexflow script

```bash

    make generate

```
### b) run Nexflow script

```bash

    make runnf 
    #or
    nextflow run nfscript/demo_nlp.nf -c config/nextflow.config
